| **[Flock: A Knowledge Graph Foundation Model via Learning on Random Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01510v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs), which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations. Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-reasoner: Foundation Models for Unified Reasoning over Graph-structured Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24276v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Foundation Models: Bridging Language Model Paradigms and Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24256v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphPFN: A Prior-Data Fitted Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21489v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However, these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior, allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes, GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their potential in graph machine learning remains largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. While many works on GFMs have focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) like TabPFNv2 or LimiX, we propose G2T-FM, a simple framework for turning tabular foundation models into graph foundation models. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies a TFM to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing competitively with, and often better than, well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines. In particular, when combined with LimiX, G2T-FM often outperforms the best GNN by a significant margin. In summary, our paper reveals the potential of a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02216v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoGraph, a scalable autoregressive model for attributed graph generation using decoder-only transformers. By flattening graphs into random sequences of tokens through a reversible process, AutoGraph enables modeling graphs as sequences without relying on additional node features that are expensive to compute, in contrast to diffusion-based approaches. This results in sampling complexity and sequence lengths that scale optimally linearly with the number of edges, making it scalable and efficient for large, sparse graphs. A key success factor of AutoGraph is that its sequence prefixes represent induced subgraphs, creating a direct link to sub-sentences in language modeling. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and molecular benchmarks, with up to 100x faster generation and 3x faster training than leading diffusion models. It also supports substructure-conditioned generation without fine-tuning and shows promising transferability, bridging language modeling and graph generation to lay the groundwork for graph foundation models. Our code is available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/AutoGraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[SEMMA: A Semantic Aware Knowledge Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20422v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) have shown promise in enabling zero-shot reasoning over unseen graphs by learning transferable patterns. However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54 diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Two Facets of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08401v4)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of LLMs, GFMs are designed to learn the optimal embedding functions from multi-domain text-attributed graphs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. Among the diverse architectures, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00614v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Of Graphs and Tables: Zero-Shot Node Classification with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07143v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast, tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns, enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders, applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for scalable and generalizable graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[G1: Teaching LLMs to Reason on Graphs with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18499v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphProp: Training the Graph Foundation Models using Graph Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04594v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification. Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However, traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract structural information and provide discriminative graph representations comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in handling graphs without node attributes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Brain Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training and Prompt-Tuning for Any Atlas and Disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02044v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

| **[Graph World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10539v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation, and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed, they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching, recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation, and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our code for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03313v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |

To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Toward a Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training Transformers With Random Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14098v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A foundation model like GPT elicits many emergent abilities, owing to the pre-training with broad inclusion of data and the use of the powerful Transformer architecture. While foundation models in natural languages are prevalent, can we build similar models for graphs? This paper describes an approach toward a graph foundation model that is pre-trained with diverse graph datasets by adapting the Transformer backbone. A central challenge toward this end is how a sequence model encodes graphs of varying sizes and from different domains. We propose representing a node as multiple random walks, such that the Transformer can extract node representations from sequences, which in turn form edge and graph representations. We develop a novel context prediction loss for these random walks and theoretically analyze their expressive power in distinguishing neighborhoods and graphs. We also demonstrate the pre-training of our model and its adaptation to downstream tasks, showcasing its potential as a foundation for processing and reasoning with graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |

Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[HYPER: A Foundation Model for Inductive Link Prediction with Knowledge Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12362v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result, cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e., relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Expressive are Knowledge Graph Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13339v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) are at the frontier for deep learning on knowledge graphs (KGs), as they can generalize to completely novel knowledge graphs with different relational vocabularies. Despite their empirical success, our theoretical understanding of KGFMs remains very limited. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous study of the expressive power of KGFMs. Specifically, we show that the expressive power of KGFMs directly depends on the motifs that are used to learn the relation representations. We then observe that the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the representations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which limits the model's expressiveness. As part of our study, we design more expressive KGFMs using richer motifs, which necessitate learning relation representations based on, e.g., how triples of relations interact with each other. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings, showing that the use of richer motifs results in better performance on a wide range of datasets drawn from different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGPT: Generative Pre-trained Graph Eulerian Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00529v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduceGraphGPT, a novel self-supervised generative pre-trained model for graph learning based on the Graph Eulerian Transformer (GET). First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD2025 |
| **[Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Models: Robust Knowledge Transfer via Topology Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02017v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Graph Neural Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1703.00552, arXiv:1403.2844 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441v3)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are pretrained on large-scale corpora to learn generalizable patterns across domains and tasks -- such as contours, textures, and edges in images, or tokens and sentences in text. In contrast, discovering such generalities in graph-structured data, especially across heterogeneous graph tasks, remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach to cross-task generalization in graphs via task-trees, which serve as unified learning instances aligning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks. We theoretically analyze the stability, transferability, and generalization properties of task-trees, showing that pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) on diverse task-trees with a reconstruction objective induces transferable knowledge. This enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To validate our framework, we introduce Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT), a graph foundation model that demonstrates strong performance on over 30 graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot generalization.

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

A Comprehensive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00829v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with broad applications across various fields. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based approaches for this task. Although many studies demonstrate the impressive performance of LLM-based methods, the lack of clear design guidelines may hinder their practical application. In this work, we aim to establish such guidelines through a fair and systematic comparison of these algorithms. As a first step, we developed LLMNodeBed, a comprehensive codebase and testbed for node classification using LLMs. It includes 10 homophilic datasets, 4 heterophilic datasets, 8 LLM-based algorithms, 8 classic baselines, and 3 learning paradigms. Subsequently, we conducted extensive experiments, training and evaluating over 2,700 models, to determine the key settings (e.g., learning paradigms and homophily) and components (e.g., model size and prompt) that affect performance. Our findings uncover 8 insights, e.g., (1) LLM-based methods can significantly outperform traditional methods in a semi-supervised setting, while the advantage is marginal in a supervised setting; (2) Graph Foundation Models can beat open-source LLMs but still fall short of strong LLMs like GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. We hope that the release of LLMNodeBed, along with our insights, will facilitate reproducible research and inspire future studies in this field.

| **[Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Relation-Aware Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12027v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising direction in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets through large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on explicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for generalization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training strategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages relation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary in LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store relational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we introduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of aggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens. In addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific projectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node representations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same relation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset pre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments show that REEF significantly outperforms existing methods on both pre-training and transfer learning tasks, underscoring its potential as a powerful foundation model for graph-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLIP-OOD: Zero-Shot Graph OOD Detection with Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21186v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in dynamic and open-world environments. In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has advanced significantly through the use of large-scale pretrained models, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). Our experiments show that, when provided only with class label names for both ID and OOD categories, the GFM can effectively perform OOD detection - often surpassing existing "supervised" OOD detection methods that rely on extensive labeled node data. We further address the practical scenario in which OOD label names are not available in real-world settings by introducing GLIP-OOD, a framework that uses LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These generated OOD labels allow the GFM to better separate ID and OOD classes, facilitating more precise OOD detection - all without any labeled nodes (only ID label names). To our knowledge, this is the first approach to achieve node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and it attains performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, current models often require extra fine-tuning to apply their learned structural and semantic representations to new graphs, which limits their versatility. Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot inductive reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs), offer us a new perspective on extending KG reasoning to general graph applications. In this paper, we introduce SCR, a unified graph reasoning framework designed to train on knowledge graphs and effectively generalize across a wide range of graph tasks and domains. We begin by designing the task-specific KG structures to establish a unified topology for different task formats. Then we propose semantic-conditioned message passing, a novel mechanism addressing the inherent semantic isolation in traditional KG reasoning, by jointly modeling structural and semantic invariance patterns in graph representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate the inductive reasoning capability of SCR using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our results show substantial performance gains over existing foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p></details> | 25 Pages, 5 figures |
| **[InfoNCE is a Free Lunch for Semantically guided Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06282v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided. Code for IFL-GCL is publicly available at: https://github.com/Camel-Prince/IFL-GCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by SIGIR2025</p></details> |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TKDE; full version (27 pages, 9 figures)</p></details> |

Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often overlook the inherent graph structures in multimodal datasets, where entities and their relationships are crucial. Multimodal graphs (MMGs) represent such graphs where each node is associated with features from different modalities, while the edges capture the relationships between these entities. On the other hand, existing graph foundation models primarily focus on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) and are not designed to handle the complexities of MMGs. To address these limitations, we propose UniGraph2, a novel cross-domain graph foundation model that enables general representation learning on MMGs, providing a unified embedding space. UniGraph2 employs modality-specific encoders alongside a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a unified low-dimensional embedding space that captures both the multimodal information and the underlying graph structure. We propose a new cross-domain multi-graph pre-training algorithm at scale to ensure effective transfer learning across diverse graph domains and modalities. Additionally, we adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) component to align features from different domains and modalities, ensuring coherent and robust embeddings that unify the information across modalities. Extensive experiments on a variety of multimodal graph tasks demonstrate that UniGraph2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in tasks such as representation learning, transfer learning, and multimodal generative tasks, offering a scalable and flexible solution for learning on MMGs.</p></details> | WWW 2025 |
| **[GOFA: A Generative One-For-All Model for Joint Graph Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09709v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/GOFA.</p></details> |  |

These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |

This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2025 Main Track</p></details> |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Foundation models in CV and NLP have shown powerful cross-domain capabilities that are also significant in graph domains. However, existing graph learning approaches struggle with cross-domain tasks. Inspired by successes in CV and NLP, cross-domain graph learning has once again become a focal point of attention to realizing true graph foundation models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis of existing works on cross-domain graph learning. Concretely, we first propose a new taxonomy, categorizing existing approaches based on the learned cross-domain information: structure, feature, and structure-feature mixture. Next, we systematically survey representative methods in these categories. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research. Relevant papers are summarized and will be consistently updated at: https://github.com/cshhzhao/Awesome-Cross-Domain-Graph-Learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Transferability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09363v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to generalize across diverse graph domains and tasks. Some works focus on Domain-Specific GFMs, which are designed to address a variety of tasks within a specific domain, while others aim to create General-Purpose GFMs that extend the capabilities of domain-specific models to multiple domains. Regardless of the type, transferability is crucial for applying GFMs across different domains and tasks. However, achieving strong transferability is a major challenge due to the structural, feature, and distributional variations in graph data. To date, there has been no systematic research examining and analyzing GFMs from the perspective of transferability. To bridge the gap, we present the first comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes and analyzes existing GFMs through the lens of transferability, structuring GFMs around their application scope (domain-specific vs. general-purpose) and their approaches to knowledge acquisition and transfer. We provide a structured perspective on current progress and identify potential pathways for advancing GFM generalization across diverse graph datasets and tasks. We aims to shed light on the current landscape of GFMs and inspire future research directions in GFM development.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the accepted paper (not the IEEE-published version).

By leveraging LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across various tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic graph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive tasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the development of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages collaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally, knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge, maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised graph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future design of LLM-based predictors.</p></details> |  |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. IO drivers, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named IOHunter, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in supervised, scarcely-supervised, and cross-IO contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSoDRZXsqj)</p></details> |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

| **[Position: Graph Learning Will Lose Relevance Due To Poor Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14546v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While machine learning on graphs has demonstrated promise in drug design and molecular property prediction, significant benchmarking challenges hinder its further progress and relevance. Current benchmarking practices often lack focus on transformative, real-world applications, favoring narrow domains like two-dimensional molecular graphs over broader, impactful areas such as combinatorial optimization, relational databases, or chip design. Additionally, many benchmark datasets poorly represent the underlying data, leading to inadequate abstractions and misaligned use cases. Fragmented evaluations and an excessive focus on accuracy further exacerbate these issues, incentivizing overfitting rather than fostering generalizable insights. These limitations have prevented the development of truly useful graph foundation models. This position paper calls for a paradigm shift toward more meaningful benchmarks, rigorous evaluation protocols, and stronger collaboration with domain experts to drive impactful and reliable advances in graph learning research, unlocking the potential of graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

While existing research has largely concentrated on learning from individual networks, this study explores the potential of learning from multiple temporal networks and its ability to transfer to unobserved networks. To achieve this, we introduce Temporal Multi-network Training MiNT, a novel pre-training approach that learns from multiple temporal networks. With a novel collection of 84 temporal transaction networks, we pre-train TGL models on up to 64 networks and assess their transferability to 20 unseen networks. Remarkably, MiNT achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot inference, surpassing models individually trained on each network. Our findings further demonstrate that increasing the number of pre-training networks significantly improves transfer performance. This work lays the groundwork for developing Temporal Graph Foundation Models, highlighting the significant potential of multi-network pre-training in TGL.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, preprint version</p></details> |

However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

We evaluate pretrained models on downstream tasks for varying amounts of training samples and choices of pretraining datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that embeddings from pretrained models improve generalization only with enough downstream data points and in a degree which depends on the quantity and properties of pretraining data.

Most existing works learn graph representation in a single constant curvature space that is insufficient to match the complex geometric shapes, resulting in low-quality embeddings with high distortion. This also constitutes a critical challenge for graph foundation models, which are expected to uniformly handle a wide variety of diverse graph data. Recent studies have indicated that product manifold gains the possibility to address topological heterogeneity. However, the product manifold is still homogeneous, which is inadequate and inflexible for representing the mixed heterogeneous topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Mixture of Riemannian Experts (GraphMoRE) framework to effectively tackle topological heterogeneity by personalized fine-grained topology geometry pattern preservation. Specifically, to minimize the embedding distortion, we propose a topology-aware gating mechanism to select the optimal embedding space for each node. By fusing the outputs of diverse Riemannian experts with learned gating weights, we construct personalized mixed curvature spaces for nodes, effectively embedding the graph into a heterogeneous manifold with varying curvatures at different points. Furthermore, to fairly measure pairwise distances between different embedding spaces, we present a concise and effective alignment strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with lower distortion, highlighting its potential for modeling complex graphs with topological heterogeneity, and providing a novel architectural perspective for graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2025)</p></details> |
| **[RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23855v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Existing approaches for graph representation learning are domain specific, maintaining consistent node and edge features across the pre-training and target datasets. This has precluded transfer to multiple domains. We present Topology Only Pre-Training (ToP), a graph pre-training method based on node and edge feature exclusion. We show positive transfer on evaluation datasets from multiple domains, including domains not present in pre-training data, running directly contrary to assumptions made in contemporary works. On 75% of experiments, ToP models perform significantly $p \leq 0.01$ better than a supervised baseline. Performance is significantly positive on 85.7% of tasks when node and edge features are used in fine-tuning. We further show that out-of-domain topologies can produce more useful pre-training than in-domain. Under ToP we show better transfer from non-molecule pre-training, compared to molecule pre-training, on 79% of molecular benchmarks. Against the limited set of other generalist graph models ToP performs strongly, including against models with many orders of magnitude larger. These findings show that ToP opens broad areas of research in both transfer learning on scarcely populated graph domains and in graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

Despite the significant progress of pre-trained graph neural networks, there haven't been GFMs that can achieve desired performance on various graph-learning-related tasks. Building GFMs may rely on a vocabulary that encodes transferable patterns shared among different tasks and domains. Unlike image and text, defining such transferable patterns for graphs remains an open question. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by rethinking the transferable patterns on graphs as computation trees -- i.e., tree structures derived from the message-passing process. Based on this insight, we propose a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named GFT, short for Graph Foundation model with transferable Tree vocabulary. By treating computation trees as tokens within the transferable vocabulary, GFT improves model generalization and reduces the risk of negative transfer. The theoretical analyses and extensive experimental studies have demonstrated the transferability of computation trees and shown the effectiveness of GFT across diverse tasks and domains in graph learning.

HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as energy and atomic forces. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility.

However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |

However, existing work usually develops separate reasoning models for different KGs, lacking the ability to generalize and transfer knowledge across diverse KGs and reasoning settings. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based KG foundation model via in-context learning, namely KG-ICL, to achieve a universal reasoning ability. Specifically, we introduce a prompt graph centered with a query-related example fact as context to understand the query relation. To encode prompt graphs with the generalization ability to unseen entities and relations in queries, we first propose a unified tokenizer that maps entities and relations in prompt graphs to predefined tokens. Then, we propose two message passing neural networks to perform prompt encoding and KG reasoning, respectively. We conduct evaluation on 43 different KGs in both transductive and inductive settings. Results indicate that the proposed KG-ICL outperforms baselines on most datasets, showcasing its outstanding generalization and universal reasoning capabilities.

| **[Enhance Graph Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11370v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in the real world. Recently, due to the powerful emergent capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in modeling graphs. The key to effectively applying LLMs on graphs is converting graph data into a format LLMs can comprehend. Graph-to-token approaches are popular in enabling LLMs to process graph information. They transform graphs into sequences of tokens and align them with text tokens through instruction tuning, where self-supervised instruction tuning helps LLMs acquire general knowledge about graphs, and supervised fine-tuning specializes LLMs for the downstream tasks on graphs. Despite their initial success, we find that existing methods have a misalignment between self-supervised tasks and supervised downstream tasks, resulting in negative transfer from self-supervised fine-tuning to downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose Graph Alignment Large Language Models (GALLM) to benefit from aligned task templates. In the self-supervised tuning stage, we introduce a novel text matching task using templates aligned with downstream tasks. In the task-specific tuning stage, we propose two category prompt methods that learn supervision information from additional explanation with further aligned templates. Experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in supervised learning, multi-dataset generalizability, and particularly in zero-shot capability, highlighting the model's potential as a graph foundation model.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing approaches pre-train models for specific graph domains, neglecting the inherent connections within networks. This limits their ability to transfer knowledge to various supervised tasks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy on graphs that focuses on modeling their multi-resolution structural information, allowing us to capture global information of the whole graph while preserving local structures around its nodes. We extend the work of Wave}let Positional Encoding (WavePE) from (Ngo et al., 2023) by pretraining a High-Order Permutation-Equivariant Autoencoder (HOPE-WavePE) to reconstruct node connectivities from their multi-resolution wavelet signals. Unlike existing positional encodings, our method is designed to become sensitivity to the input graph size in downstream tasks, which efficiently capture global structure on graphs. Since our approach relies solely on the graph structure, it is also domain-agnostic and adaptable to datasets from various domains, therefore paving the wave for developing general graph structure encoders and graph foundation models. We theoretically demonstrate that there exists a parametrization of such architecture that it can predict the output adjacency up to arbitrarily low error. We also evaluate HOPE-WavePE on graph-level prediction tasks of different areas and show its superiority compared to other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v4)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |

Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Neural Scaling Laws Exist on Graph Self-Supervised Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11243v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning~(SSL) is essential to obtain foundation models in NLP and CV domains via effectively leveraging knowledge in large-scale unlabeled data. The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often struggle to effectively extract generalizable insights, frequently requiring extensive fine-tuning and limiting their versatility. Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19941v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BooG-EE42/.</p></details> |  |

This dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to build a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored for node classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different domains. Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14899v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A variety of knowledge graph embedding approaches have been developed. Most of them obtain embeddings by learning the structure of the knowledge graph within a link prediction setting. As a result, the embeddings reflect only the structure of a single knowledge graph, and embeddings for different knowledge graphs are not aligned, e.g., they cannot be used to find similar entities across knowledge graphs via nearest neighbor search. However, knowledge graph embedding applications such as entity disambiguation require a more global representation, i.e., a representation that is valid across multiple sources. We propose to learn universal knowledge graph embeddings from large-scale interlinked knowledge sources. To this end, we fuse large knowledge graphs based on the owl:sameAs relation such that every entity is represented by a unique identity. We instantiate our idea by computing universal embeddings based on DBpedia and Wikidata yielding embeddings for about 180 million entities, 15 thousand relations, and 1.2 billion triples. We believe our computed embeddings will support the emerging field of graph foundation models. Moreover, we develop a convenient API to provide embeddings as a service. Experiments on link prediction suggest that universal knowledge graph embeddings encode better semantics compared to embeddings computed on a single knowledge graph. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our source code and datasets open access.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

We show that the self-attention layers of foundation models can effectively be repurposed on graphs to perform cross-node attention-based message-passing. Our model is evaluated on a real-world image network dataset and two biological applications (single-cell RNA sequencing data and fMRI brain activity recordings) in both finetuned and zero-shot settings.

This is highlighted by the generative capabilities of NLP models like GPT-4, and the retrieval-based approaches of CV models like CLIP, both of which effectively bridge the gap between seen and unseen data. In the realm of graph learning, the continuous emergence of new graphs and the challenges of human labeling also amplify the necessity for zero-shot transfer learning, driving the exploration of approaches that can generalize across diverse graph data without necessitating dataset-specific and label-specific fine-tuning. In this study, we extend such paradigms to zero-shot transferability in graphs by introducing ZeroG, a new framework tailored to enable cross-dataset generalization. Addressing the inherent challenges such as feature misalignment, mismatched label spaces, and negative transfer, we leverage a language model to encode both node attributes and class semantics, ensuring consistent feature dimensions across datasets. We also propose a prompt-based subgraph sampling module that enriches the semantic information and structure information of extracted subgraphs using prompting nodes and neighborhood aggregation, respectively. We further adopt a lightweight fine-tuning strategy that reduces the risk of overfitting and maintains the zero-shot learning efficacy of the language model. The results underscore the effectiveness of our model in achieving significant cross-dataset zero-shot transferability, opening pathways for the development of graph foundation models.

One of the most notable advancements of LLMs is that a single model is trained on vast and diverse datasets spanning multiple domains -- a paradigm we term `All in One'. This methodology empowers LLMs with super generalization capabilities, facilitating an encompassing comprehension of varied data distributions. Leveraging these capabilities, a single LLM demonstrates remarkable versatility across a variety of domains -- a paradigm we term `One for All'. However, applying this idea to the graph field remains a formidable challenge, with cross-domain pretraining often resulting in negative transfer. This issue is particularly important in few-shot learning scenarios, where the paucity of training data necessitates the incorporation of external knowledge sources. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Graph COordinators for PrEtraining (GCOPE), that harnesses the underlying commonalities across diverse graph datasets to enhance few-shot learning. Our novel methodology involves a unification framework that amalgamates disparate graph datasets during the pretraining phase to distill and transfer meaningful knowledge to target tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets demonstrate the superior efficacy of our approach. By successfully leveraging the synergistic potential of multiple graph datasets for pretraining, our work stands as a pioneering contribution to the realm of graph foundational model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD'24, August 25-29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |

A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems. First, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with unified problem settings hinders a clear understanding of the comparative effectiveness and practical value of different text-space GFMs. Second, there is a lack of sufficient datasets to thoroughly explore the methods' full potential and verify their effectiveness across diverse settings. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark providing novel text-space datasets and comprehensive evaluation under unified problem settings.

Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency. The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation. 4) Training Stop Criteria. Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks. To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies. Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research. The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Graph Foundation Models are Already Here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02216v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are emerging as a significant research topic in the graph domain, aiming to develop graph models trained on extensive and diverse data to enhance their applicability across various tasks and domains. Developing GFMs presents unique challenges over traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are typically trained from scratch for specific tasks on particular datasets. The primary challenge in constructing GFMs lies in effectively leveraging vast and diverse graph data to achieve positive transfer. Drawing inspiration from existing foundation models in the CV and NLP domains, we propose a novel perspective for the GFM development by advocating for a ``graph vocabulary'', in which the basic transferable units underlying graphs encode the invariance on graphs. We ground the graph vocabulary construction from essential aspects including network analysis, expressiveness, and stability. Such a vocabulary perspective can potentially advance the future GFM design in line with the neural scaling laws. All relevant resources with GFM design can be found here.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models for Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07478v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions. In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs). While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval. In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization. Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types. To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity. To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type. This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data. Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform.</p></details> |  |

With the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) reporting an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities, the traditional manual analysis becomes untenably time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper introduces VulnScopper, an innovative approach that utilizes multi-modal representation learning, combining Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to automate and enhance the analysis of software vulnerabilities. Leveraging ULTRA, a knowledge graph foundation model, combined with a Large Language Model (LLM), VulnScopper effectively handles unseen entities, overcoming the limitations of previous KG approaches. We evaluate VulnScopper on two major security datasets, the NVD and the Red Hat CVE database. Our method significantly improves the link prediction accuracy between Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWEs), and Common Platform Enumerations (CPEs). Our results show that VulnScopper outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 78% Hits@10 accuracy in linking CVEs to CPEs and CWEs and presenting an 11.7% improvement over large language models in predicting CWE labels based on the Red Hat database. Based on the NVD, only 6.37% of the linked CPEs are being published during the first 30 days; many of them are related to critical and high-risk vulnerabilities which, according to multiple compliance frameworks (such as CISA and PCI), should be remediated within 15-30 days. Our model can uncover new products linked to vulnerabilities, reducing remediation time and improving vulnerability management. We analyzed several CVEs from 2023 to showcase this ability.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph Your Own Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23373v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGMP:Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07405v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25)</p></details> |

Enlightened by prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover, we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries, where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts on average.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |

As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph prompting from different domains.

In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.

Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appeared in KDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does Graph Prompt Work? A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

To efficiently adapt ViG to downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like visual prompting become increasingly essential. However, existing prompting methods are primarily designed for Transformer-based models, neglecting the rich topological relationships among nodes and edges in graph-based representations, limiting their capacity to model complex semantics. In this paper, we propose Vision Graph Prompting (VGP), a novel framework tailored for vision graph structures. Our core insight reveals that semantically connected components in the graph exhibit low-rank properties. Building on this observation, we introduce a semantic low-rank prompting method that decomposes low-rank semantic features and integrates them with prompts on vision graph topologies, capturing both global structural patterns and fine-grained semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly improves ViG's transfer performance on diverse downstream tasks, achieving results comparable to full fine-tuning while maintaining parameter efficiency.

However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods.

| **[CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

| **[Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[GraphPrompter: Multi-stage Adaptive Prompt Optimization for Graph In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02027v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%.

Most existing studies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational contexts. However, due to the short and sparse nature of conversational contexts, it is difficult to fully capture user preferences by conversational contexts only. We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user preference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a certain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling storyline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt learning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image features of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture higher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities (collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph structures. Finally, we propose an innovative integration of multi-modal semantic graphs with prompt learning, harnessing the power of large language models to comprehensively explore high-dimensional semantic relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves accuracy in item recommendation, as well as generates more natural and contextually relevant content in response generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach. We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion. With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peer ...</summary><p>Peer reviewed and published at NLP4KGc @ Semantics 2024, see original publication at https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3874/paper3.pdf .

However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |

Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

However, inevitable objective gaps often exist between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompt tuning techniques design and learn graph prompts by manipulating input graphs or reframing downstream tasks as pre-training tasks without fine-tuning the pre-trained GNN models. While recent graph prompt tuning methods have proven effective in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks, they overlook the crucial role of edges in graph prompt design, which can significantly affect the quality of graph representations for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose EdgePrompt, a simple yet effective graph prompt tuning method from the perspective of edges. Unlike previous studies that design prompt vectors on node features, EdgePrompt manipulates input graphs by learning additional prompt vectors for edges and incorporates the edge prompts through message passing in the pre-trained GNN models to better embed graph structural information for downstream tasks. Our method is compatible with prevalent GNN architectures pre-trained under various pre-training strategies and is universal for different downstream tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analyses of our method regarding its capability of handling node classification and graph classification as downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on ten graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against six baselines.

These online activities raise significant social concerns that require immediate actions. Existing approaches to combating this challenge are generally impractical, due to the imbalance of classes and scarcity of labeled samples in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a novel Large Language Model-empowered Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning framework for illicit Drug Trafficking detection, called LLM-HetGDT, that leverages LLM to facilitate heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to effectively identify drug trafficking activities in the class-imbalanced scenarios. Specifically, we first pre-train HGNN over a contrastive pretext task to capture the inherent node and structure information over the unlabeled drug trafficking heterogeneous graph (HG). Afterward, we employ LLM to augment the HG by generating high-quality synthetic user nodes in minority classes. Then, we fine-tune the soft prompts on the augmented HG to capture the important information in the minority classes for the downstream drug trafficking detection task. To comprehensively study online illicit drug trafficking activities, we collect a new HG dataset over Twitter, called Twitter-HetDrug. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of LLM-HetGDT.</p></details> |  |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs.

Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which integrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially enhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning with large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning mechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate relevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process more efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new Follow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input, with follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions either inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or use special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our experiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial computational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NAACL 2025.

| **[CLEAR: Cluster-based Prompt Learning on Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08918v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has attracted increasing attention in the graph domain as a means to bridge the gap between pretext and downstream tasks. Existing studies on heterogeneous graph prompting typically use feature prompts to modify node features for specific downstream tasks, which do not concern the structure of heterogeneous graphs. Such a design also overlooks information from the meta-paths, which are core to learning the high-order semantics of the heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose CLEAR, a Cluster-based prompt LEARNING model on heterogeneous graphs. We present cluster prompts that reformulate downstream tasks as heterogeneous graph reconstruction. In this way, we align the pretext and downstream tasks to share the same training objective. Additionally, our cluster prompts are also injected into the meta-paths such that the prompt learning process incorporates high-order semantic information entailed by the meta-paths. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks confirm the superiority of CLEAR. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5% improvement on the F1 metric for node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

The prevailing "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the "negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |
| **[DAGPrompT: Pushing the Limits of Graph Prompting with a Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15142v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-train then fine-tune approach has advanced GNNs by enabling general knowledge capture without task-specific labels. However, an objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks limits its effectiveness. Recent graph prompting methods aim to close this gap through task reformulations and learnable prompts. Despite this, they struggle with complex graphs like heterophily graphs. Freezing the GNN encoder can reduce the impact of prompting, while simple prompts fail to handle diverse hop-level distributions. This paper identifies two key challenges in adapting graph prompting methods for complex graphs: (1) adapting the model to new distributions in downstream tasks to mitigate pre-training and fine-tuning discrepancies from heterophily and (2) customizing prompts for hop-specific node requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning (DAGPrompT), which integrates a GLoRA module for optimizing the GNN encoder's projection matrix and message-passing schema through low-rank adaptation. DAGPrompT also incorporates hop-specific prompts accounting for varying graph structures and distributions among hops. Evaluations on 10 datasets and 14 baselines demonstrate that DAGPrompT improves accuracy by up to 4.79 in node and graph classification tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art while preserving efficiency.

Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

| **[SAM-Aware Graph Prompt Reasoning Network for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00303v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary challenge of cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is the domain disparity between the training and inference phases, which can exist in either the input data or the target classes. Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Prompt-based Unifying Inference Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15735v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide important prospective insights in applications such as social behavior analysis and financial risk analysis based on their powerful learning capabilities on graph data. Nevertheless, GNNs' predictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so it is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the downstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph prompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data leakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can infer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data (publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking the raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference attacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference capabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named ProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the graph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference attack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional disentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant knowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack capabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |
| **[LLMs as Zero-shot Graph Learners: Alignment of GNN Representations with LLM Token Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14512v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |

A Few-Shot Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11387v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the robotics domain by enabling robots to comprehend and execute natural language instructions. The cornerstone benefits of LLM include processing textual data from technical manuals, instructions, academic papers, and user queries based on the knowledge provided. However, deploying LLM-generated code in robotic systems without safety verification poses significant risks. This paper outlines a safety layer that verifies the code generated by ChatGPT before executing it to control a drone in a simulated environment. The safety layer consists of a fine-tuned GPT-4o model using Few-Shot learning, supported by knowledge graph prompting (KGP). Our approach improves the safety and compliance of robotic actions, ensuring that they adhere to the regulations of drone operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17676v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks stand as the predominant technique for graph representation learning owing to their strong expressive power, yet the performance highly depends on the availability of high-quality labels in an end-to-end manner. Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been proposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the pretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt learning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with minimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the current exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on learning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the diverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming to generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process involves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight architecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and employing the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings showcase the superior performance of IA-GPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Despite its growing prominence, the privacy risks inherent in GPL remain unexplored. In this study, we provide the first evaluation of privacy leakage in GPL across three attacker capabilities: black-box attacks when GPL as a service, and scenarios where node embeddings and prompt representations are accessible to third parties. We assess GPL's privacy vulnerabilities through Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) and Link Inference Attacks (LIAs), finding that under any capability, attackers can effectively infer the properties and relationships of sensitive nodes, and the success rate of inference on some data sets is as high as 98%. Importantly, while targeted inference attacks on specific prompts (e.g., GPF-plus) maintain high success rates, our analysis suggests that the prompt-tuning in GPL does not significantly elevate privacy risks compared to traditional GNNs. To mitigate these risks, we explored defense mechanisms, identifying that Laplacian noise perturbation can substantially reduce inference success, though balancing privacy protection with model performance remains challenging. This work highlights critical privacy risks in GPL, offering new insights and foundational directions for future privacy-preserving strategies in graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods generally focus on a single graph object type (node, edge, graph, etc.) and often overlook the inherent connections among different object types of graph anomalies. For instance, a money laundering transaction might involve an abnormal account and the broader community it interacts with. To address this, we present UniGAD, the first unified framework for detecting anomalies at node, edge, and graph levels jointly. Specifically, we develop the Maximum Rayleigh Quotient Subgraph Sampler (MRQSampler) that unifies multi-level formats by transferring objects at each level into graph-level tasks on subgraphs. We theoretically prove that MRQSampler maximizes the accumulated spectral energy of subgraphs (i.e., the Rayleigh quotient) to preserve the most significant anomaly information. To further unify multi-level training, we introduce a novel GraphStitch Network to integrate information across different levels, adjust the amount of sharing required at each level, and harmonize conflicting training goals. Comprehensive experiments show that UniGAD outperforms both existing GAD methods specialized for a single task and graph prompt-based approaches for multiple tasks, while also providing robust zero-shot task transferability.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Against Multifaceted Graph Heterogeneity via Asymmetric Federated Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02003v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) aims to collaboratively and privately optimize graph models on divergent data for different tasks. A critical challenge in FGL is to enable effective yet efficient federated optimization against multifaceted graph heterogeneity to enhance mutual performance. However, existing FGL works primarily address graph data heterogeneity and perform incapable of graph task heterogeneity. To address the challenge, we propose a Federated Graph Prompt Learning (FedGPL) framework to efficiently enable prompt-based asymmetric graph knowledge transfer between multifaceted heterogeneous federated participants. Generally, we establish a split federated framework to preserve universal and domain-specific graph knowledge, respectively. Moreover, we develop two algorithms to eliminate task and data heterogeneity for advanced federated knowledge preservation. First, a Hierarchical Directed Transfer Aggregator (HiDTA) delivers cross-task beneficial knowledge that is hierarchically distilled according to the directional transferability. Second, a Virtual Prompt Graph (VPG) adaptively generates graph structures to enhance data utility by distinguishing dominant subgraphs and neutralizing redundant ones. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant accuracy and efficiency effectiveness of FedGPL against multifaceted graph heterogeneity compared to state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale federated graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDIPrompt: Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction based on Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472v5)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug combinations can cause adverse drug-drug interactions(DDIs). Identifying specific effects is crucial for developing safer therapies. Previous works on DDI event prediction have typically been limited to using labels of specific events as supervision, which renders them insufficient to address two significant challenges: (1) the bias caused by \textbf{highly imbalanced event distribution} where certain interaction types are vastly under-represented. (2) the \textbf{scarcity of labeled data for rare events}, a pervasive issue where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-explored due to limited available data. In response, we offer ``DDIPrompt'', an innovative solution inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompt learning. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt features a hierarchical pre-training strategy to foster a generalized and comprehensive understanding of drug properties. It captures intra-molecular structures through augmented links based on structural proximity between drugs, further learns inter-molecular interactions emphasizing edge connections rather than concrete catagories. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate DDIPrompt's SOTA performance, especially for those rare DDI events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable and Compact Graph Fine-tuning via GraphSparse Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21749v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph prompt learning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. However, existing works generally conduct prompting over all graph elements (e.g., nodes, edges, node attributes, etc.), which is suboptimal and obviously redundant. To address this issue, we propose exploiting sparse representation theory for graph prompting and present Graph Sparse Prompting (GSP). GSP aims to adaptively and sparsely select the optimal elements (e.g., certain node attributes) to achieve compact prompting for downstream tasks. Specifically, we propose two kinds of GSP models, termed Graph Sparse Feature Prompting (GSFP) and Graph Sparse multi-Feature Prompting (GSmFP). Both GSFP and GSmFP provide a general scheme for tuning any specific pre-trained GNNs that can achieve attribute selection and compact prompt learning simultaneously. A simple yet effective algorithm has been designed for solving GSFP and GSmFP models. Experiments on 16 widely-used benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSFPs.</p></details> |  |

Graph CIL (GCIL) follows the same setting but needs to deal with graph tasks (e.g., node classification in a graph). The key characteristic of CIL lies in the absence of task identifiers (IDs) during inference, which causes a significant challenge in separating classes from different tasks (i.e., inter-task class separation). Being able to accurately predict the task IDs can help address this issue, but it is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show theoretically that accurate task ID prediction on graph data can be achieved by a Laplacian smoothing-based graph task profiling approach, in which each graph task is modeled by a task prototype based on Laplacian smoothing over the graph. It guarantees that the task prototypes of the same graph task are nearly the same with a large smoothing step, while those of different tasks are distinct due to differences in graph structure and node attributes. Further, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge learned in previous graph tasks, we propose a novel graph prompting approach for GCIL which learns a small discriminative graph prompt for each task, essentially resulting in a separate classification model for each task. The prompt learning requires the training of a single graph neural network (GNN) only once on the first task, and no data replay is required thereafter, thereby obtaining a GCIL model being both replay-free and forget-free. Extensive experiments on four GCIL benchmarks show that i) our task prototype-based method can achieve 100% task ID prediction accuracy on all four datasets, ii) our GCIL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 18% in average CIL accuracy, and iii) our model is fully free of forgetting on the four datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning.

The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable.

This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.

This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems.

However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

To reduce labeling requirement, the "pre-train, prompt" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE.

Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose \textbf{One for All (OFA)}, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands. Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution. However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies. To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation. Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views. After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph. Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph. Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views. These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated. Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[GTP-4o: Modality-prompted Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Omni-modal Biomedical Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05540v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in learning multi-modal representation have witnessed the success in biomedical domains. While established techniques enable handling multi-modal information, the challenges are posed when extended to various clinical modalities and practical modalitymissing setting due to the inherent modality gaps. To tackle these, we propose an innovative Modality-prompted Heterogeneous Graph for Omnimodal Learning (GTP-4o), which embeds the numerous disparate clinical modalities into a unified representation, completes the deficient embedding of missing modality and reformulates the cross-modal learning with a graph-based aggregation. Specially, we establish a heterogeneous graph embedding to explicitly capture the diverse semantic properties on both the modality-specific features (nodes) and the cross-modal relations (edges). Then, we design a modality-prompted completion that enables completing the inadequate graph representation of missing modality through a graph prompting mechanism, which generates hallucination graphic topologies to steer the missing embedding towards the intact representation. Through the completed graph, we meticulously develop a knowledge-guided hierarchical cross-modal aggregation consisting of a global meta-path neighbouring to uncover the potential heterogeneous neighbors along the pathways driven by domain knowledge, and a local multi-relation aggregation module for the comprehensive cross-modal interaction across various heterogeneous relations. We assess the efficacy of our methodology on rigorous benchmarking experiments against prior state-of-the-arts. In a nutshell, GTP-4o presents an initial foray into the intriguing realm of embedding, relating and perceiving the heterogeneous patterns from various clinical modalities holistically via a graph theory.

| **[MMGPL: Multimodal Medical Data Analysis with Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14574v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has demonstrated impressive efficacy in the fine-tuning of multimodal large models to a wide range of downstream tasks. Nonetheless, applying existing prompt learning methods for the diagnosis of neurological disorder still suffers from two issues: (i) existing methods typically treat all patches equally, despite the fact that only a small number of patches in neuroimaging are relevant to the disease, and (ii) they ignore the structural information inherent in the brain connection network which is crucial for understanding and diagnosing neurological disorders. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel prompt learning model by learning graph prompts during the fine-tuning process of multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Specifically, we first leverage GPT-4 to obtain relevant disease concepts and compute semantic similarity between these concepts and all patches. Secondly, we reduce the weight of irrelevant patches according to the semantic similarity between each patch and disease-related concepts. Moreover, we construct a graph among tokens based on these concepts and employ a graph convolutional network layer to extract the structural information of the graph, which is used to prompt the pre-trained multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance for neurological disorder diagnosis compared with state-of-the-art methods and validated by clinicians.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProG: A Graph Prompt Learning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05346v2)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial general intelligence on graphs has shown significant advancements across various applications, yet the traditional 'Pre-train & Fine-tune' paradigm faces inefficiencies and negative transfer issues, particularly in complex and few-shot settings. Graph prompt learning emerges as a promising alternative, leveraging lightweight prompts to manipulate data and fill the task gap by reformulating downstream tasks to the pretext. However, several critical challenges still remain: how to unify diverse graph prompt models, how to evaluate the quality of graph prompts, and to improve their usability for practical comparisons and selection. In response to these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for graph prompt learning. Our benchmark integrates SIX pre-training methods and FIVE state-of-the-art graph prompt techniques, evaluated across FIFTEEN diverse datasets to assess performance, flexibility, and efficiency. We also present 'ProG', an easy-to-use open-source library that streamlines the execution of various graph prompt models, facilitating objective evaluations. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that categorizes existing graph prompt methods into two main approaches: prompts as graphs and prompts as tokens. This framework enhances the applicability and comparison of graph prompt techniques. The code is available at: https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Graph Selective Prompt Learning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10498v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompt learning/tuning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained models for graph representation learning. As a kind of universal graph prompt learning method, Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) has achieved remarkable success in adapting pre-trained models for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By fixing the parameters of a pre-trained GNN model, the aim of GPF is to modify the input graph data by adding some (learnable) prompt vectors into graph node features to better align with the downstream tasks on the smaller dataset. However, existing GPFs generally suffer from two main limitations. First, GPFs generally focus on node prompt learning which ignore the prompting for graph edges. Second, existing GPFs generally conduct the prompt learning on all nodes equally which fails to capture the importances of different nodes and may perform sensitively w.r.t noisy nodes in aligning with the downstream tasks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new unified Graph Selective Prompt Feature learning (GSPF) for GNN fine-tuning. The proposed GSPF integrates the prompt learning on both graph node and edge together, which thus provides a unified prompt model for the graph data. Moreover, it conducts prompt learning selectively on nodes and edges by concentrating on the important nodes and edges for prompting which thus make our model be more reliable and compact. Experimental results on many benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSPF method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Pro: A Self-Prompt and Tuning Framework for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10362v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become an important modeling tool for web applications, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning. However, the performance of traditional GNNs heavily relies on a large amount of supervision. Recently, ``pre-train, fine-tune'' has become the paradigm to address the issues of label dependency and poor generalization. However, the pre-training strategies vary for graphs with homophily and heterophily, and the objectives for various downstream tasks also differ. This leads to a gap between pretexts and downstream tasks, resulting in ``negative transfer'' and poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), many studies turn to bridge the gap and fully leverage the pre-trained model. However, existing methods for graph prompting are tailored to homophily, neglecting inherent heterophily on graphs. Meanwhile, most of them rely on the randomly initialized prompts, which negatively impact on the stability. Therefore, we propose Self-Prompt, a prompting framework for graphs based on the model and data itself. We first introduce asymmetric graph contrastive learning for pretext to address heterophily and align the objectives of pretext and downstream tasks. Then we reuse the component from pre-training phase as the self adapter and introduce self-prompts based on graph itself for task adaptation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets to demonstrate its superiority.

While GPL offers superior effectiveness in graph knowledge transfer and computational efficiency, the security risks posed by backdoor poisoning effects embedded in pretrained models remain largely unexplored. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of GPL's vulnerability to backdoor attacks. We introduce \textit{CrossBA}, the first cross-context backdoor attack against GPL, which manipulates only the pretraining phase without requiring knowledge of downstream applications. Our investigation reveals both theoretically and empirically that tuning trigger graphs, combined with prompt transformations, can seamlessly transfer the backdoor threat from pretrained encoders to downstream applications. Through extensive experiments involving 3 representative GPL methods across 5 distinct cross-context scenarios and 5 benchmark datasets of node and graph classification tasks, we demonstrate that \textit{CrossBA} consistently achieves high attack success rates while preserving the functionality of downstream applications over clean input. We also explore potential countermeasures against \textit{CrossBA} and conclude that current defenses are insufficient to mitigate \textit{CrossBA}. Our study highlights the persistent backdoor threats to GPL systems, raising trustworthiness concerns in the practices of GPL techniques.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15240v5)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has sparked a research surge in adapting pre-trained models. Unlike the unified pre-training strategy employed in the language field, the graph field exhibits diverse pre-training strategies, posing challenges in designing appropriate prompt-based tuning methods for graph neural networks. While some pioneering work has devised specialized prompting functions for models that employ edge prediction as their pre-training tasks, these methods are limited to specific pre-trained GNN models and lack broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce a universal prompt-based tuning method called Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for pre-trained GNN models under any pre-training strategy. GPF operates on the input graph's feature space and can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect to any form of prompting function. Consequently, we no longer need to illustrate the prompting function corresponding to each pre-training strategy explicitly. Instead, we employ GPF to obtain the prompted graph for the downstream task in an adaptive manner. We provide rigorous derivations to demonstrate the universality of GPF and make guarantee of its effectiveness. The experimental results under various pre-training strategies indicate that our method performs better than fine-tuning, with an average improvement of about 1.4% in full-shot scenarios and about 3.2% in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms existing specialized prompt-based tuning methods when applied to models utilizing the pre-training strategy they specialize in. These numerous advantages position our method as a compelling alternative to fine-tuning for downstream adaptations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Prompt Learning on Temporal Interaction Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06326v2)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Interaction Graphs (TIGs) are widely utilized to represent real-world systems. To facilitate representation learning on TIGs, researchers have proposed a series of TIG models. However, these models are still facing two tough gaps between the pre-training and downstream predictions in their ``pre-train, predict'' training paradigm. First, the temporal discrepancy between the pre-training and inference data severely undermines the models' applicability in distant future predictions on the dynamically evolving data. Second, the semantic divergence between pretext and downstream tasks hinders their practical applications, as they struggle to align with their learning and prediction capabilities across application scenarios. Recently, the ``pre-train, prompt'' paradigm has emerged as a lightweight mechanism for model generalization. Applying this paradigm is a potential solution to solve the aforementioned challenges. However, the adaptation of this paradigm to TIGs is not straightforward. The application of prompting in static graph contexts falls short in temporal settings due to a lack of consideration for time-sensitive dynamics and a deficiency in expressive power. To address this issue, we introduce Temporal Interaction Graph Prompting (TIGPrompt), a versatile framework that seamlessly integrates with TIG models, bridging both the temporal and semantic gaps. In detail, we propose a temporal prompt generator to offer temporally-aware prompts for different tasks. These prompts stand out for their minimalistic design, relying solely on the tuning of the prompt generator with very little supervision data. To cater to varying computational resource demands, we propose an extended ``pre-train, prompt-based fine-tune'' paradigm, offering greater flexibility. Through extensive experiments, the TIGPrompt demonstrates the SOTA performance and remarkable efficiency advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, due to the immense gap of data and tasks between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, the model performance is still limited. Inspired by prompt fine-tuning in Natural Language Processing(NLP), many endeavors have been made to bridge the gap in graph domain. But existing methods simply reformulate the form of fine-tuning tasks to the pre-training ones. With the premise that the pre-training graphs are compatible with the fine-tuning ones, these methods typically operate in transductive setting. In order to generalize graph pre-training to inductive scenario where the fine-tuning graphs might significantly differ from pre-training ones, we propose a novel graph prompt based method called Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt(IGAP). Firstly, we unify the mainstream graph pre-training frameworks and analyze the essence of graph pre-training from graph spectral theory. Then we identify the two sources of the data gap in inductive setting: (i) graph signal gap and (ii) graph structure gap. Based on the insight of graph pre-training, we propose to bridge the graph signal gap and the graph structure gap with learnable prompts in the spectral space. A theoretical analysis ensures the effectiveness of our method. At last, we conduct extensive experiments among nodes classification and graph classification tasks under the transductive, semi-inductive and inductive settings. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully bridge the data gap under different settings.</p></details> |  |

However, few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LLM-based graph traversal agent that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the graph traversal agent acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA.</p></details> |  |

However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a ''negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to poor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks.

| **[Contrastive Graph Prompt-tuning for Cross-domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10685v2)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are frequently challenged by the data sparsity problem. One approach to mitigate this issue is through cross-domain recommendation techniques. In a cross-domain context, sharing knowledge between domains can enhance the effectiveness in the target domain. Recent cross-domain methods have employed a pre-training approach, but we argue that these methods often result in suboptimal fine-tuning, especially with large neural models. Modern language models utilize prompts for efficient model tuning. Such prompts act as a tunable latent vector, allowing for the freezing of the main model parameters. In our research, we introduce the Personalised Graph Prompt-based Recommendation (PGPRec) framework. This leverages the advantages of prompt-tuning. Within this framework, we formulate personalized graph prompts item-wise, rooted in items that a user has previously engaged with. Specifically, we employ Contrastive Learning (CL) to produce pre-trained embeddings that offer greater generalizability in the pre-training phase, ensuring robust training during the tuning phase. Our evaluation of PGPRec in cross-domain scenarios involves comprehensive testing with the top-k recommendation tasks and a cold-start analysis. Our empirical findings, based on four Amazon Review datasets, reveal that the PGPRec framework can decrease the tuned parameters by as much as 74%, maintaining competitive performance. Remarkably, there's an 11.41% enhancement in performance against the leading baseline in cold-start situations.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations and the extensive layering in graph transformer architectures present challenges when applying them to graph based prediction tasks. Fine-tuning, a common approach, is resource-intensive and requires storing multiple copies of large models. We propose a novel approach called deep graph prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging large graph transformer models in downstream graph based prediction tasks. Our method introduces trainable feature nodes to the graph and pre-pends task-specific tokens to the graph transformer, enhancing the model's expressive power. By freezing the pre-trained parameters and only updating the added tokens, our approach reduces the number of free parameters and eliminates the need for multiple model copies, making it suitable for small datasets and scalable to large graphs. Through extensive experiments on various-sized datasets, we demonstrate that deep graph prompt tuning achieves comparable or even superior performance to fine-tuning, despite utilizing significantly fewer task-specific parameters. Our contributions include the introduction of prompt tuning for graph transformers, its application to both graph transformers and message passing graph neural networks, improved efficiency and resource utilization, and compelling experimental results. This work brings attention to a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models in graph based prediction tasks and offers new opportunities for exploring and advancing graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

While many GNN-based solutions have emerged, the supervised paradigm depends on a large quantity of labeled data. A popular alternative is to adopt self-supervised pre-training using label-free data, and further fine-tune on a downstream task with limited labels. Nevertheless, the "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm is often plagued by the objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks. Hence, we propose VPGNN, a prompt-based fine-tuning framework on GNNs for voucher abuse detection. We design a novel graph prompting function to reformulate the downstream task into a similar template as the pretext task in pre-training, thereby narrowing the objective gap.

Some models also incorporate knowledge bases without the need for pre-training. This is because the base model already contains domain-specific knowledge during the pre-training process. We build a large language model for food testing. Unlike the above approach, a significant amount of data in this domain exists in Scanning format for domain standard documents. In addition, there is a large amount of untrained structured knowledge. Therefore, we introduce an incremental pre-training step to inject this knowledge into a large language model. In this paper, we propose a method for handling structured knowledge and scanned documents in incremental pre-training. To overcome the problem of machine hallucination, we constructe a knowledge graph to serve as an external knowledge base for supporting retrieval in the large language model. It is worth mentioning that this paper is a technical report of our pre-release version, and we will report our specific experimental data in future versions.</p></details> |  |

However, there exists an inherent gap between pretext and downstream graph tasks, which insufficiently exerts the ability of pre-trained models and even leads to negative transfer. Meanwhile, prompt tuning has seen emerging success in natural language processing by aligning pre-training and fine-tuning with consistent training objectives. In this paper, we identify the challenges for graph prompt tuning: The first is the lack of a strong and universal pre-training task across sundry pre-training methods in graph domain. The second challenge lies in the difficulty of designing a consistent training objective for both pre-training and downstream tasks. To overcome above obstacles, we propose a novel framework named SGL-PT which follows the learning strategy ``Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict''. Specifically, we raise a strong and universal pre-training task coined as SGL that acquires the complementary merits of generative and contrastive self-supervised graph learning. And aiming for graph classification task, we unify pre-training and fine-tuning by designing a novel verbalizer-free prompting function, which reformulates the downstream task in a similar format as pretext task. Empirical results show that our method surpasses other baselines under unsupervised setting, and our prompt tuning method can greatly facilitate models on biological datasets over fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |

The approach involves using a pre-trained model and a prompting function that applies a template to input samples, adding indicative context and reformulating target tasks as the pre-training task. However, the design of prompts could be a challenging and time-consuming process in complex tasks. The limitation can be addressed by using graph data, as graphs serve as structured knowledge repositories by explicitly modeling the interaction between entities. In this survey, we review prompting methods from the graph perspective, where prompting functions are augmented with graph knowledge. In particular, we introduce the basic concepts of graph prompt learning, organize the existing work of designing graph prompting functions, and describe their applications and future challenges. This survey will bridge the gap between graphs and prompt design to facilitate future methodology development.</p></details> | 9 pages + 1 figure |

Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01910v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Most existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11356v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework introducing two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions, equipping the method with a fallback mechanism guaranteeing a performance lower bound even on non-fractal graphs. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61\%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional and latest baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 4\%. Codes are available at (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FractalGCL-0511/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Gene Regulatory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17786v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and to be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided but a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments and using the latter as explicit supervisory signals. To assess effectiveness, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate their performance on downstream tasks. The evaluation includes both node-level tasks, such as gene function classification, and graph-level tasks on patient-specific GRNs, such as patient survival hazard prediction. Across 13 tasks built from GRN datasets derived from patients with three cancer types, SupGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[PGCLODA: Prompt-Guided Graph Contrastive Learning for Oligopeptide-Infectious Disease Association Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20290v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.</p></details> | 12page and 8 figures |
| **[CueGCL: Cluster-aware Personalized Self-Training for Unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11073v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as one of the optimal solutions for node-level and supervised tasks. However, for structure-related and unsupervised tasks such as graph clustering, current GCL algorithms face difficulties acquiring the necessary cluster-level information, resulting in poor performance. In addition, general unsupervised GCL improves the performance of downstream tasks by increasing the number of negative samples, which leads to severe class collision and unfairness of graph clustering. To address the above issues, we propose a Cluster-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Framework (CueGCL) to jointly learn clustering results and node representations. Specifically, we design a personalized self-training (PeST) strategy for unsupervised scenarios, which enables our model to capture precise cluster-level personalized information. With the benefit of the PeST, we alleviate class collision and unfairness without sacrificing the overall model performance. Furthermore, aligned graph clustering (AGC) is employed to obtain the cluster partition, where we align the clustering space of our downstream task with that in PeST to achieve more consistent node embeddings. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing it yields an embedding space with a significantly discernible cluster structure. Extensive experimental results also show our CueGCL exhibits state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets with different scales.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Acoustic event Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14893v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal acoustic event classification plays a key role in audio-visual systems. Although combining audio and visual signals improves recognition, it is still difficult to align them over time and to reduce the effect of noise across modalities. Existing methods often treat audio and visual streams separately, fusing features later with contrastive or mutual information objectives. Recent advances explore multimodal graph learning, but most fail to distinguish between intra- and inter-modal temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose Temporally Heterogeneous Graph-based Contrastive Learning (THGCL). Our framework constructs a temporal graph for each event, where audio and video segments form nodes and their temporal links form edges. We introduce Gaussian processes for intra-modal smoothness, Hawkes processes for inter-modal decay, and contrastive learning to capture fine-grained relationships. Experiments on AudioSet show that THGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To showcase this, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," as restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL not only effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge but also significantly enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05115v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems, demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Despite notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations. Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,conference</p></details> |
| **[Robust Graph Contrastive Learning with Information Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12555v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework has gained remarkable achievements in graph representation learning. However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world social media data exhibits an imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts. To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by COLING2025</p></details> |

Most existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However, through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2) retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI2024</p></details> |

However, conventional GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety of datasets and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Graph...</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network, Representation Learning</p></details> |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

| **[Revisiting Graph Contrastive Learning on Anomaly Detection: A Structural Imbalance Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14677v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its application to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems. Unfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall detection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance, which can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law degree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail anomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the security and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore hinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly detection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the above issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It devises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and facilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to forged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to enlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor completion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the original and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance evaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates the comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head anomalies and tail anomalies.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Self-supervised graph learning seeks to harness high-order collaborative filtering signals through unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite graph, primarily leveraging a multi-task learning framework that includes both supervised recommendation loss and self-supervised contrastive loss. However, this separate design introduces additional graph convolution processes and creates inconsistencies in gradient directions due to disparate losses, resulting in prolonged training times and sub-optimal performance. In this study, we introduce a unified framework of Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for recommendation (SGCL) to address these issues. SGCL uniquely combines the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses into a cohesive supervised contrastive learning loss, aligning both tasks within a single optimization direction for exceptionally fast training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in RecSys 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2404.15954</p></details> |

To address the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that maximizes mutual information between contrastive views. However, existing GCL methods rely on augmentation techniques that introduce semantically irrelevant noise and incur significant computational and storage costs, limiting effectiveness and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose NLGCL, a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages naturally contrastive views between neighbor layers within GNNs. By treating each node and its neighbors in the next layer as positive pairs, and other nodes as negatives, NLGCL avoids augmentation-based noise while preserving semantic relevance. This paradigm eliminates costly view construction and storage, making it computationally efficient and practical for real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that NLGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys 2025 as Spotlight Oral</p></details> |
| **[When Graph Contrastive Learning Backfires: Spectral Vulnerability and Defense in Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07436v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated substantial promise in enhancing the robustness and generalization of recommender systems, particularly by enabling models to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for improved representation learning. However, in this paper, we reveal an unexpected vulnerability: the integration of GCL inadvertently increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. Through both theoretical investigation and empirical validation, we identify the root cause as the spectral smoothing effect induced by contrastive optimization, which disperses item embeddings across the representation space and unintentionally enhances the exposure of target items. Building on this insight, we introduce CLeaR, a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies spectral smoothness, enabling a systematic investigation of the susceptibility of GCL-based recommendation models to targeted promotion attacks. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust countermeasures; in response, we further propose SIM, a spectral irregularity mitigation framework designed to accurately detect and suppress targeted items without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing targeted promotion attacks, GCL-based recommendation models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Str-GCL: Structural Commonsense Driven Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07141v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes, which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL). Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in graph representation learning.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |
| **[DecoyDB: A Dataset for Graph Contrastive Learning in Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06366v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning, especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes. However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal (negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Contrastive Representation Learning in Augmented Biomedical Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01644v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical Knowledge Graphs (BKGs) integrate diverse datasets to elucidate complex relationships within the biomedical field. Effective link prediction on these graphs can uncover valuable connections, such as potential novel drug-disease relations. We introduce a novel multimodal approach that unifies embeddings from specialized Language Models (LMs) with Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) to enhance intra-entity relationships while employing a Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model to capture inter-entity relationships for effective link prediction. To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present PrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including biological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By combining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our approach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link predictions even for unseen nodes. Experimental results on PrimeKG++ and the DrugBank drug-target interaction dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse biomedical datasets.

| **[Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization and Low-Rank Attention for Noisy Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09600v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in learning node representations and have shown strong performance in tasks such as node classification. However, recent findings indicate that the presence of noise in real-world graph data can substantially impair the effectiveness of GNNs. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust and innovative node representation learning method named Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization, or GCL-LRR, which follows a two-stage transductive learning framework for node classification. In the first stage, the GCL-LRR encoder is optimized through prototypical contrastive learning while incorporating a low-rank regularization objective. In the second stage, the representations generated by GCL-LRR are employed by a linear transductive classifier to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes within the graph. Our GCL-LRR is inspired by the Low Frequency Property (LFP) of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank regularization in transductive learning, which is also supported by strong empirical results. To further enhance the performance of GCL-LRR, we present an improved model named GCL-LR-Attention, which incorporates a novel LR-Attention layer into GCL-LRR. GCL-LR-Attention reduces the kernel complexity of GCL-LRR and contributes to a tighter generalization bound, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets evidence the effectiveness and robustness of both GCL-LRR and GCL-LR-Attention in learning meaningful node representations. The code is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/GCL-LR-Attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Model-Driven Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06212v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs) to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Degree Bias Adaptively with Hard-to-Learn Nodes in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05214v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information. This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.</p></details> |  |

While direct supervision is limited, such graphs frequently contain weak signals, noisy or indirect cues, that can still inform learning. We propose WSNET, a novel weakly supervised graph contrastive learning framework that leverages these weak signals to guide robust representation learning. WSNET integrates graph structure, node features, and multiple noisy supervision sources through a contrastive objective tailored for weakly labeled data. Across three real world datasets and synthetic benchmarks with controlled noise, WSNET consistently outperforms state of the art contrastive and noisy label learning methods by up to 15% in F1 score. Our results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive learning under weak supervision and the promise of exploiting imperfect labels in graph based settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often apply heuristic augmentation like random edge dropping, which may disrupt important graph structures and result in unstable GCL performance. In this paper, we propose Positive-incentive Noise driven Graph Data Augmentation (PiNGDA), where positive-incentive noise (pi-noise) scientifically analyzes the beneficial effect of noise under the information theory. To bridge the standard GCL and pi-noise framework, we design a Gaussian auxiliary variable to convert the loss function to information entropy. We prove that the standard GCL with pre-defined augmentations is equivalent to estimate the beneficial noise via the point estimation. Following our analysis, PiNGDA is derived from learning the beneficial noise on both topology and attributes through a trainable noise generator for graph augmentations, instead of the simple estimation. Since the generator learns how to produce beneficial perturbations on graph topology and node attributes, PiNGDA is more reliable compared with the existing methods. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and stability of PiNGDA.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGCL: Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning for User-Item Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19020v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which fuses graph neural networks with contrastive learning, has evolved as a pivotal tool in user-item recommendations. While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph. Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, the additional label information does not always contribute positively to the GCN. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (i.e., ELU-graph), which allows the additional label information to positively influence the predictions of GCN. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</p></details> |  |

Among graph-based learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs. However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL (Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across various domains.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce DICE, a Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, which is the first graph neural network (GNN) pretrained via self-supervised learning specifically tailored for graph-level prediction tasks in both analog and digital circuits. DICE adopts a simulation-free pretraining approach based on graph contrastive learning, leveraging two novel graph augmentation techniques.

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

The existing methods addressing the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric Learning (NML) enhanced GCL (NML-GCL). NML-GCL employs a learnable Negative Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative similarity over artificial absolute similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025; full version including appendix</p></details> |

Traditional GCL optimizes InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided.

| **[A Generative Graph Contrastive Learning Model with Global Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18148v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has garnered significant attention recently since it learns complex structural information from graphs through self-supervised learning manner. However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from performance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely, they commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which leads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In addition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby ignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building a singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to obtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise perturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL) with an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of hard and easy sample pairs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSG2L outperforms the state-of-art baselines. Moreover, CSG2L is compatible with a variety of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

GCL approaches can be categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that can generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require negative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Submitted to ICML |

A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during graph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on these new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm is effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In this paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient descent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph convolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood aggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability through experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the selection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of CL objective. Based on this discovery, we propose the Light Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (LightCCF) method, which introduces a novel neighborhood aggregation objective to bring users closer to all interacted items while pushing them away from other positive pairs, thus achieving high-quality neighborhood aggregation with very low time complexity. On three highly sparse public datasets, the proposed method effectively aggregate neighborhood information while preventing graph over-smoothing, demonstrating significant improvements over existing GCL-based counterparts in both training efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Our implementations are publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR2025</p></details> |

The process of constructing perturbed views of the user-item bipartite graph and performing contrastive learning between perturbed views in a graph convolutional network (GCN) is called graph contrastive learning (GCL), which aims to enhance the robustness of representation learning. Although existing GCL-based models are effective, the weight assignment method for perturbed views has not been fully explored. A critical problem in existing GCL-based models is the irrational allocation of feature attention. This problem limits the model's ability to effectively leverage crucial features, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning framework (WeightedGCL). Specifically, WeightedGCL applies a robust perturbation strategy, which perturbs only the view of the final GCN layer. In addition, WeightedGCL incorporates a squeeze and excitation network (SENet) to dynamically weight the features of the perturbed views. Our WeightedGCL strengthens the model's focus on crucial features and reduces the impact of less relevant information. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our WeightedGCL achieves significant accuracy improvements compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, including text-to-SQL. While prior works have explored various strategies for prompting LLMs to generate SQL statements, they still fall short of fully harnessing the power of LLM due to the lack of (1) high-quality contextual information when constructing the prompts and (2) robust feedback mechanisms to correct translation errors. To address these challenges, we propose MageSQL, a text-to-SQL approach based on in-context learning over LLMs. MageSQL explores a suite of techniques that leverage the syntax and semantics of SQL queries to identify relevant few-shot demonstrations as context for prompting LLMs. In particular, we introduce a graph-based demonstration selection method -- the first of its kind in the text-to-SQL problem -- that leverages graph contrastive learning adapted with SQL-specific data augmentation strategies. Furthermore, an error correction module is proposed to detect and fix potential inaccuracies in the generated SQL query. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several benchmarking datasets. The results show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by an obvious margin.</p></details> |  |

Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |

In contrast to traditional supervised learning relying on a large number of labels, GCL exploits augmentation strategies to generate multiple views and positive/negative pairs, both of which greatly influence the performance. Unfortunately, commonly used random augmentations may disturb the underlying semantics of graphs. Moreover, traditional GNNs, a type of widely employed encoders in GCL, are inevitably confronted with over-smoothing and over-squashing problems. To address these issues, we propose GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning (GTCA), which inherits the advantages of both GNN and Transformer, incorporating graph topology to obtain comprehensive graph representations. Theoretical analysis verifies the trustworthiness of the proposed method.

Despite significant advancements in this domain, including methods based on RNNs and self-attention, challenges like limited supervised signals and noisy data caused by unintentional clicks persist. To address these challenges, some studies have incorporated unsupervised learning by leveraging local item contexts within individual sequences. However, these methods often overlook the intricate associations between items across multiple sequences and are susceptible to noise in item co-occurrence patterns. In this context, we introduce a novel framework, Global Unsupervised Data-Augmentation (UDA4SR), which adopts a graph contrastive learning perspective to generate more robust item embeddings for sequential recommendation. Our approach begins by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, which serves as the first step to enhance the diversity and richness of the training data. Then, we build a Global Item Relationship Graph (GIG) based on all user interaction sequences. Subsequently, we employ graph contrastive learning on the refined graph to enhance item embeddings by capturing complex global associations. To model users' dynamic and diverse interests more effectively, we enhance the CapsNet module with a novel target-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UDA4SR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does GCL Need a Large Number of Negative Samples? Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Effective and Efficient Negative Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17908v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to self-supervised learn low-dimensional graph representations, primarily through instance discrimination, which involves manually mining positive and negative pairs from graphs, increasing the similarity of positive pairs while decreasing negative pairs. Drawing from the success of Contrastive Learning (CL) in other domains, a consensus has been reached that the effectiveness of GCLs depends on a large number of negative pairs. As a result, despite the significant computational overhead, GCLs typically leverage as many negative node pairs as possible to improve model performance. However, given that nodes within a graph are interconnected, we argue that nodes cannot be treated as independent instances. Therefore, we challenge this consensus: Does employing more negative nodes lead to a more effective GCL model? To answer this, we explore the role of negative nodes in the commonly used InfoNCE loss for GCL and observe that: (1) Counterintuitively, a large number of negative nodes can actually hinder the model's ability to distinguish nodes with different semantics. (2) A smaller number of high-quality and non-topologically coupled negative nodes are sufficient to enhance the discriminability of representations. Based on these findings, we propose a new method called GCL with Effective and Efficient Negative samples, E2Neg, which learns discriminative representations using only a very small set of representative negative samples. E2Neg significantly reduces computational overhead and speeds up model training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of E2Neg across multiple datasets compared to other GCL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-augmented Graph Contrastive Learning for Collaborative Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16290v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based collaborative filtering has been established as a prominent approach in recommendation systems, leveraging the inherent graph topology of user-item interactions to model high-order connectivity patterns and enhance recommendation performance. Recent advances in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate data sparsity issues by improving representation learning through contrastive view generation and mutual information maximization. However, existing approaches lack effective data augmentation strategies. Structural augmentation risks distorting fundamental graph topology, while feature-level perturbation techniques predominantly employ uniform noise scales that fail to account for node-specific characteristics. To solve these challenges, we propose Diffusion-augmented Contrastive Learning (DGCL), an innovative framework that integrates diffusion models with contrastive learning for enhanced collaborative filtering. Our approach employs a diffusion process that learns node-specific Gaussian distributions of representations, thereby generating semantically consistent yet diversified contrastive views through reverse diffusion sampling. DGCL facilitates adaptive data augmentation based on reconstructed representations, considering both semantic coherence and node-specific features. In addition, it explores unrepresented regions of the latent sparse feature space, thereby enriching the diversity of contrastive views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCL on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively. Visualizations further show tighter intra-cluster aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am requesting the withdrawal of my paper due to errors identified in the methodology and experimental results.

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization. The code of DoG is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/DoG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches often neglect the critical role of subgraph structures, particularly the intra-subgraph characteristics and inter-subgraph relationships, which are crucial for generating informative and diverse contrastive pairs. These subgraph features are crucial as they vary significantly across different graph types, such as social networks where they represent communities, and biochemical networks where they symbolize molecular interactions. To address this issue, our work proposes a novel subgraph-oriented learnable augmentation method for graph contrastive learning, termed SOLA-GCL, that centers around subgraphs, taking full advantage of the subgraph information for data augmentation. Specifically, SOLA-GCL initially partitions a graph into multiple densely connected subgraphs based on their intrinsic properties. To preserve and enhance the unique characteristics inherent to subgraphs, a graph view generator optimizes augmentation strategies for each subgraph, thereby generating tailored views for graph contrastive learning. This generator uses a combination of intra-subgraph and inter-subgraph augmentation strategies, including node dropping, feature masking, intra-edge perturbation, inter-edge perturbation, and subgraph swapping. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various graph learning applications, ranging from social networks to molecules, under semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning settings to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art in GCL.</p></details> |  |

However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two.

Presently, the majority of research methods primarily concentrate on the analysis of amino acid sequences, while investigations predicated on protein structures remain in the nascent stages of exploration. Despite the emergence of several structure-based algorithms in recent years, these are still confronted with inherent challenges: (1) the extraction of intrinsic structural information of proteins typically necessitates the expenditure of substantial computational resources; (2) these models are overly reliant on seen protein data, struggling to effectively unearth interaction cues between unknown proteins. To further propel advancements in this domain, this paper introduces a novel PPI prediction method jointing masked reconstruction and contrastive learning, termed JmcPPI. This methodology dissects the PPI prediction task into two distinct phases: during the residue structure encoding phase, JmcPPI devises two feature reconstruction tasks and employs graph attention mechanism to capture structural information between residues; during the protein interaction inference phase, JmcPPI perturbs the original PPI graph and employs a multi-graph contrastive learning strategy to thoroughly mine extrinsic interaction information of novel proteins. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely utilized PPI datasets demonstrate that JmcPPI surpasses existing optimal baseline models across various data partition schemes.

However, the problem of insufficient supervision, together with representation collapse, largely limits the performance of the GNNs in this field. To alleviate the collapse of node representations in semi-supervised scenario, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, termed Mixed Graph Contrastive Network (MGCN). In our method, we improve the discriminative capability of the latent embeddings by an interpolation-based augmentation strategy and a correlation reduction mechanism. Specifically, we first conduct the interpolation-based augmentation in the latent space and then force the prediction model to change linearly between samples. Second, we enable the learned network to tell apart samples across two interpolation-perturbed views through forcing the correlation matrix across views to approximate an identity matrix. By combining the two settings, we extract rich supervision information from both the abundant unlabeled nodes and the rare yet valuable labeled nodes for discriminative representation learning. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the generality of MGCN compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code of MGCN is available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/MGCN on Github.</p></details> |  |

While graph machine learning holds great promise across various domains, the design of effective pretext tasks for self-supervised graph representation learning remains challenging. Contrastive learning, a popular approach in graph self-supervised learning, leverages positive and negative pairs to compute a contrastive loss function. However, current graph contrastive learning methods often struggle to fully use structural patterns and node similarities. To address these issues, we present a new method called Fused Gromov Wasserstein Subgraph Contrastive Learning (FOSSIL). Our model integrates node-level and subgraph-level contrastive learning, seamlessly combining a standard node-level contrastive loss with the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This combination helps our method capture both node features and graph structure together. Importantly, our approach works well with both homophilic and heterophilic graphs and can dynamically create views for generating positive and negative pairs. Through extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets, we show that FOSSIL outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, relying on predefined augmentations (e.g., node dropping, edge perturbation, attribute masking) may result in the loss of task-relevant information and a lack of adaptability to diverse input data. Furthermore, the selection of negative samples remains rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce HyperGCL, a novel multimodal GCL framework from a hypergraph perspective. HyperGCL constructs three distinct hypergraph views by jointly utilizing the input graph's structure and attributes, enabling a comprehensive integration of multiple modalities in contrastive learning. A learnable adaptive topology augmentation technique enhances these views by preserving important relations and filtering out noise. View-specific encoders capture essential characteristics from each view, while a network-aware contrastive loss leverages the underlying topology to define positive and negative samples effectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperGCL achieves state-of-the-art node classification performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

To this end, Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a leading approach. The embeddings of CL are arranged on a hypersphere where similarity is measured by the cosine distance. However, many real-world graphs, especially of hierarchical nature, cannot be embedded well in the Euclidean space. Although the hyperbolic embedding is suitable for hierarchical representation learning, naively applying CL to the hyperbolic space may result in the so-called dimension collapse, i.e., features will concentrate mostly within few density regions, leading to poor utilization of the whole feature space. Thus, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn high-quality graph embeddings in hyperbolic space. Specifically, we design the alignment metric that effectively captures the hierarchical data-invariant information, as well as we propose a substitute of the uniformity metric to prevent the so-called dimensional collapse. We show that in the hyperbolic space one has to address the leaf- and height-level uniformity related to properties of trees. In the ambient space of the hyperbolic manifold these notions translate into imposing an isotropic ring density towards boundaries of Poincar\'e ball. Our experiments support the efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by The 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 2025</p></details> |

GCL reduces reliance on labeled data by learning robust representations from various augmented views. However, existing GCL methods typically depend on consistent stochastic augmentations, which overlook their impact on the intrinsic structure of the spectral domain, thereby limiting the model's ability to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm called AS-GCL that incorporates asymmetric spectral augmentation for graph contrastive learning. A typical GCL framework consists of three key components: graph data augmentation, view encoding, and contrastive loss. Our method introduces significant enhancements to each of these components. Specifically, for data augmentation, we apply spectral-based augmentation to minimize spectral variations, strengthen structural invariance, and reduce noise. With respect to encoding, we employ parameter-sharing encoders with distinct diffusion operators to generate diverse, noise-resistant graph views. For contrastive loss, we introduce an upper-bound loss function that promotes generalization by maintaining a balanced distribution of intra- and inter-class distance. To our knowledge, we are the first to encode augmentation views of the spectral domain using asymmetric encoders. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets across various node-level tasks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM |

GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels.

| **[Contrastive Learning Meets Pseudo-label-assisted Mixup Augmentation: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Framework from Local to Global](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18357v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various graph representation learning tasks. However, most existing GNNs focus primarily on capturing local information through explicit graph convolution, often neglecting global message-passing. This limitation hinders the establishment of a collaborative interaction between global and local information, which is crucial for comprehensively understanding graph data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning (ComGRL). ComGRL integrates local information into global information to derive powerful representations. It achieves this by implicitly smoothing local information through flexible graph contrastive learning, ensuring reliable representations for subsequent global exploration. Then ComGRL transfers the locally derived representations to a multi-head self-attention module, enhancing their discriminative ability by uncovering diverse and rich global correlations. To further optimize local information dynamically under the self-supervision of pseudo-labels, ComGRL employs a triple sampling strategy to construct mixed node pairs and applies reliable Mixup augmentation across attributes and structure for local contrastive learning. This approach broadens the receptive field and facilitates coordination between local and global representation learning, enabling them to reinforce each other.

| **[Conditional Distribution Learning on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Fusion Self-supervised Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19692v4)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are widely deployed in various web environments, and self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in this field. Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals. Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques. Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges. i) Data augmentation ($e.g.,$ discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality. ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals. However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Fusion Self-supervised Learning framework for recommendation. Specifically, instead of facilitating data augmentations, we use high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views. Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective. By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior recommendation performance and efficiency of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Short Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09219v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short text classification has gained significant attention in the information age due to its prevalence and real-world applications. Recent advancements in graph learning combined with contrastive learning have shown promising results in addressing the challenges of semantic sparsity and limited labeled data in short text classification. However, existing models have certain limitations. They rely on explicit data augmentation techniques to generate contrastive views, resulting in semantic corruption and noise. Additionally, these models only focus on learning the intrinsic consistency between the generated views, neglecting valuable discriminative information from other potential views. To address these issues, we propose a Simple graph contrastive learning framework for Short Text Classification (SimSTC). Our approach involves performing graph learning on multiple text-related component graphs to obtain multi-view text embeddings. Subsequently, we directly apply contrastive learning on these embeddings. Notably, our method eliminates the need for data augmentation operations to generate contrastive views while still leveraging the benefits of multi-view contrastive learning. Despite its simplicity, our model achieves outstanding performance, surpassing large language models on various datasets.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the issue of heterophily in real-world heterogeneous graphs (HGs) has been largely overlooked. To bridge this research gap, we proposed a novel heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework, termed HGMS, which leverages connection strength and multi-view self-expression to learn homophilous node representations. Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy that enhances the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we introduce a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix. The solved self-expressive matrix serves as an additional augmented view to provide homophilous information and is used to identify false negatives in contrastive loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HGMS across different downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of graph-based structures, such as bipartite graphs, has gained popularity for their ability to analyze complex data relationships. Link prediction is crucial for recommending specific items to users. Traditional methods in this area often involve identifying patterns in the graph structure or using representational techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches encounter difficulties as the volume of data increases. To address these challenges, we propose a model called Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-label Classification (MCGCL). MCGCL leverages contrastive learning to enhance recommendation effectiveness. The model incorporates two training stages: a main task and a subtask. The main task is holistic user-item graph learning to capture user-item relationships. The homogeneous user-user (item-item) subgraph is constructed to capture user-user and item-item relationships in the subtask. We assessed the performance using real-world datasets from Amazon Reviews in multi-label classification tasks. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods confirm the effectiveness of MCGCL, highlighting its potential for improving recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions and the idea of positive-incentive noise, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentations. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges based on the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks on Graph-level Tasks: Comprehensive Experiments, Analysis, and Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perfect Alignment May be Poisonous to Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03977v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to learn node representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones. However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

| **[CLDG: Contrastive Learning on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14451v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph with complex annotations is the most potent data type, whose constantly evolving motivates further exploration of the unsupervised dynamic graph representation. One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods. Compared with the existing dynamic graph method, the number of model parameters and training time is reduced by an average of 2,001.86 times and 130.31 times on seven datasets, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2023 |
| **[SE-GCL: An Event-Based Simple and Effective Graph Contrastive Learning for Text Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11652v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text representation learning is significant as the cornerstone of natural language processing. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and capture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current mainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation of domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation process, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of GCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing word-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic information in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative textual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph contrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract event blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent inter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical semantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised graph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of the event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data capture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core representation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation techniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic efficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to converge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately achieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed SE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to verify its effectiveness in text representation learning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 tables |

However, edgelevel contrasts are not well explored by most existing GCL methods. Most studies in GCL only regard edges as auxiliary information while updating node features. One of the primary obstacles of edge-based GCL is the heavy computation burden. To tackle this issue, we propose a model that can efficiently learn edge features for GCL, namely AugmentationFree Edge Contrastive Learning (AFECL) to achieve edgeedge contrast. AFECL depends on no augmentation consisting of two parts. Firstly, we design a novel edge feature generation method, where edge features are computed by embedding concatenation of their connected nodes. Secondly, an edge contrastive learning scheme is developed, where edges connecting the same nodes are defined as positive pairs, and other edges are defined as negative pairs. Experimental results show that compared with recent state-of-the-art GCL methods or even some supervised GNNs, AFECL achieves SOTA performance on link prediction and semi-supervised node classification of extremely scarce labels.

To mitigate reliance on cross-view contrasts, we propose \ttt{SIGNA}, a novel single-view graph contrastive learning framework. Regarding the inconsistency between structural connection and semantic similarity of neighborhoods, we resort to soft neighborhood awareness for GCL. Specifically, we leverage dropout to obtain structurally-related yet randomly-noised embedding pairs for neighbors, which serve as potential positive samples. At each epoch, the role of partial neighbors is switched from positive to negative, leading to probabilistic neighborhood contrastive learning effect. Furthermore, we propose a normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence estimator for a better effect of contrastive learning. Surprisingly, experiments on diverse node-level tasks demonstrate that our simple single-view GCL framework consistently outperforms existing methods by margins of up to 21.74% (PPI). In particular, with soft neighborhood awareness, SIGNA can adopt MLPs instead of complicated GCNs as the encoder to generate representations in transductive learning tasks, thus speeding up its inference process by 109 times to 331 times.

| **[Uncovering Capabilities of Model Pruning in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20356v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning has achieved great success in pre-training graph neural networks without ground-truth labels. Leading graph contrastive learning follows the classical scheme of contrastive learning, forcing model to identify the essential information from augmented views. However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</p></details> | MM' 24 |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network(GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering(CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning(CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCLS$^2$: Towards Efficient Community Detection Using Graph Contrastive Learning with Structure Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11273v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the power of learning representations from unlabeled graphs, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown excellent performance in community detection tasks. Existing GCL-based methods on the community detection usually focused on learning attribute representations of individual nodes, which, however, ignores structural semantics of communities (e.g., nodes in the same community should be structurally cohesive). Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the community detection under the community structure semantics and propose an effective framework for graph contrastive learning under structure semantics (GCLS$^2$) to detect communities. To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the structure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes, which can better capture the topology of communities. To adapt to large-scale networks, we design a high-level graph partitioning (HGP) algorithm that minimizes the community detection loss for GCLS$^2$ online training. It is worth noting that we prove a lower bound on the training of GCLS$^2$ from the perspective of the information theory, explaining why GCLS$^2$ can learn a more accurate representation of the structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$ outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy, modularity, and efficiency of detecting communities.</p></details> |  |

However, label noise can degrade the global model's generalization performance. Existing federated label noise learning methods, primarily focused on computer vision, often yield suboptimal results when applied to FGL. To address this, we propose a robust federated graph learning method with label noise, termed FedRGL. FedRGL introduces dual-perspective consistency noise node filtering, leveraging both the global model and subgraph structure under class-aware dynamic thresholds. To enhance client-side training, we incorporate graph contrastive learning, which improves encoder robustness and assigns high-confidence pseudo-labels to noisy nodes. Additionally, we measure model quality via predictive entropy of unlabeled nodes, enabling adaptive robust aggregation of the global model. Comparative experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets show that FedRGL outperforms 12 baseline methods across various noise rates, types, and numbers of clients.</p></details> |  |

The conventional GCL approaches incorporate negative samples uniformly in the contrastive loss, resulting in the equal treatment of negative nodes, regardless of their proximity to the true positive. In this paper, we present a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to inject proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in the contrastive loss, thus significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties associated with node pairs in contrastive loss by incorporating three distinct smoothing techniques that result in proximity-aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability for large-scale graphs, the proposed framework incorporates a graph batch-generating strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs, facilitating efficient training in separate batches. Through extensive experimentation in the unsupervised setting on various benchmarks, particularly those of large scale, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against recent baselines.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Existing methods primarily employ auxiliary information to predict tail entity given head entity and its relation, yet face challenges due to the occasional unavailability of such detailed information and the inherent simplicity of predicting tail entities based on semantic similarities. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to predict unobserved relations between the head and tail entity in a zero-shot manner, their performance is still restricted due to the inability to leverage all the (exponentially many) paths' information between two entities, which are critical in collectively indicating their relation types. To address this, in this work, we introduce a Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (CTLP), which encodes all the paths' information in linear time complexity to predict unseen relations between entities, attaining both efficiency and information preservation. Specifically, we design a condensed transition graph encoder with theoretical guarantees on its coverage, expressiveness, and efficiency. It is learned by a transition graph contrastive learning strategy. Subsequently, we design a soft instruction tuning to learn and map the all-path embedding to the input of LLMs. Experimental results show that our proposed CTLP method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSLP datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICDM 2024</p></details> |

However, explicit graph augmentations may lead to a loss of semantics in the contrastive views. Secondly, existing methods tend to overlook edge features and the varying significance of node features during multi-graph learning. Moreover, the contrastive loss suffer from false negatives. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method of contrastive multi-graph learning with neighbor hierarchical sifting for semi-supervised text classification, namely ConNHS. Specifically, we exploit core features to form a multi-relational text graph, enhancing semantic connections among texts. By separating text graphs, we provide diverse views for contrastive learning. Our approach ensures optimal preservation of the graph information, minimizing data loss and distortion. Then, we separately execute relation-aware propagation and cross-graph attention propagation, which effectively leverages the varying correlations between nodes and edge features while harmonising the information fusion across graphs. Subsequently, we present the neighbor hierarchical sifting loss (NHS) to refine the negative selection. For one thing, following the homophily assumption, NHS masks first-order neighbors of the anchor and positives from being negatives. For another, NHS excludes the high-order neighbors analogous to the anchor based on their similarities. Consequently, it effectively reduces the occurrence of false negatives, preventing the expansion of the distance between similar samples in the embedding space. Our experiments on ThuCNews, SogouNews, 20 Newsgroups, and Ohsumed datasets achieved 95.86\%, 97.52\%, 87.43\%, and 70.65\%, which demonstrates competitive results in semi-supervised text classification.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Especially inductive GNNs, which allow for the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications. As such these networks become attractive targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing model-stealing attacks that extract models trained on images and texts. However, little attention has been given to stealing GNNs trained on graph data. This paper identifies a new method of performing unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, utilizing graph contrastive learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the targeted model. The new type of attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets and the results show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art by Shen et al. (2021). In particular, our attack surpasses the baseline across all benchmarks, attaining superior fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while necessitating fewer queries directed toward the target model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI - 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to detect fake news on future events. Recently, numerous fake news detection models that utilize textual information and the propagation structure of posts have been proposed. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge since they rely heavily on event-specific features for prediction and cannot generalize to unseen events. To address this, we introduce \textbf{F}uture \textbf{AD}aptive \textbf{E}vent-based Fake news Detection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor through an adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to obtain higher-quality features and make more accurate overall predictions. Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biased predictions. We further mitigate event bias by subtracting the event-only predictor's output from the target predictor's output to obtain the final prediction. Encouraging results from experiments designed to emulate real-world social media conditions validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07150v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into low-dimensional vectors. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of graph characteristics while controlling the distribution of generated subgraphs. We employ optimal transport distances, including Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SGEC outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negative-Free Self-Supervised Gaussian Embedding of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01157v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a promising graph self-supervised learning framework for learning discriminative node representations without labels. The widely adopted objective function of GCL benefits from two key properties: \emph{alignment} and \emph{uniformity}, which align representations of positive node pairs while uniformly distributing all representations on the hypersphere. The uniformity property plays a critical role in preventing representation collapse and is achieved by pushing apart augmented views of different nodes (negative pairs). As such, existing GCL methods inherently rely on increasing the quantity and quality of negative samples, resulting in heavy computational demands, memory overhead, and potential class collision issues. In this study, we propose a negative-free objective to achieve uniformity, inspired by the fact that points distributed according to a normalized isotropic Gaussian are uniformly spread across the unit hypersphere. Therefore, we can minimize the distance between the distribution of learned representations and the isotropic Gaussian distribution to promote the uniformity of node representations. Our method also distinguishes itself from other approaches by eliminating the need for a parameterized mutual information estimator, an additional projector, asymmetric structures, and, crucially, negative samples. Extensive experiments over seven graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposal achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, shorter training times, and lower memory consumption compared to existing GCL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

Some studies utilize learning-based methods for brain network analysis, but typically suffer from low model generalizability caused by scarce labeled fMRI data. As a notable self-supervised strategy, graph contrastive learning helps leverage auxiliary unlabeled data. But existing methods generally arbitrarily perturb graph nodes/edges to generate augmented graphs, without considering essential topology information of brain networks. To this end, we propose a topology-aware graph augmentation (TGA) framework, comprising a pretext model to train a generalizable encoder on large-scale unlabeled fMRI cohorts and a task-specific model to perform downstream tasks on a small target dataset. In the pretext model, we design two novel topology-aware graph augmentation strategies: (1) hub-preserving node dropping that prioritizes preserving brain hub regions according to node importance, and (2) weight-dependent edge removing that focuses on keeping important functional connectivities based on edge weights. Experiments on 1, 688 fMRI scans suggest that TGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The one of the effective ways to reduce the number of samples is using hard negatives (e.g., Mixup). Designing mixing-based approach for GAD can be difficult due to imbalanced data or limited number of anomalies. We propose ANOMIX, a framework that consists of a novel graph mixing approach, ANOMIX-M, and multi-level contrasts for GAD. ANOMIX-M can effectively mix abnormality and normality from input graph to generate hard negatives, which are important for efficient GCL. ANOMIX is (a) A first mixing approach: firstly attempting graph mixing to generate hard negatives for GAD task and node- and subgraph-level contrasts to distinguish underlying anomalies. (b) Accurate: winning the highest AUC, up to 5.49% higher and 1.76% faster. (c) Effective: reducing the number of samples nearly 80% in GCL.

| **[Binary Code Similarity Detection via Graph Contrastive Learning on Intermediate Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18561v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary Code Similarity Detection (BCSD) plays a crucial role in numerous fields, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, and code reuse identification. As IoT devices proliferate and rapidly evolve, their highly heterogeneous hardware architectures and complex compilation settings, coupled with the demand for large-scale function retrieval in practical applications, put forward higher requirements for BCSD methods. In this paper, we propose IRBinDiff, which mitigates compilation differences by leveraging LLVM-IR with higher-level semantic abstraction, and integrates a pre-trained language model with a graph neural network to capture both semantic and structural information from different perspectives. By introducing momentum contrastive learning, it effectively enhances retrieval capabilities in large-scale candidate function sets, distinguishing between subtle function similarities and differences. Our extensive experiments, conducted under varied compilation settings, demonstrate that IRBinDiff outperforms other leading BCSD methods in both One-to-one comparison and One-to-many search scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

A recommender system is considered unfair when it produces unequal outcomes for different user groups based on user-sensitive attributes (e.g., age, gender). Some researchers have proposed data augmentation-based methods aiming at alleviating user-level unfairness by altering the skewed distribution of training data among various user groups. Despite yielding promising results, they often rely on fairness-related assumptions that may not align with reality, potentially reducing the data quality and negatively affecting model effectiveness. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we study how to implement high-quality data augmentation to improve recommendation fairness. Specifically, we propose FairDgcl, a dynamic graph adversarial contrastive learning framework aiming at improving fairness in recommender system. First, FairDgcl develops an adversarial contrastive network with a view generator and a view discriminator to learn generating fair augmentation strategies in an adversarial style. Then, we propose two dynamic, learnable models to generate contrastive views within contrastive learning framework, which automatically fine-tune the augmentation strategies. Meanwhile, we theoretically show that FairDgcl can simultaneously generate enhanced representations that possess both fairness and accuracy. Lastly, comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FairDgcl.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to TKDE</p></details> |

The existing research on efficient data augmentation methods and ideal pretext tasks for graph contrastive learning remains limited, resulting in suboptimal node representation in the unsupervised setting. In this paper, we introduce LAC, a graph contrastive learning framework with learnable data augmentation in an orthogonal continuous space. To capture the representative information in the graph data during augmentation, we introduce a continuous view augmenter, that applies both a masked topology augmentation module and a cross-channel feature augmentation module to adaptively augment the topological information and the feature information within an orthogonal continuous space, respectively. The orthogonal nature of continuous space ensures that the augmentation process avoids dimension collapse. To enhance the effectiveness of pretext tasks, we propose an information-theoretic principle named InfoBal and introduce corresponding pretext tasks. These tasks enable the continuous view augmenter to maintain consistency in the representative information across views while maximizing diversity between views, and allow the encoder to fully utilize the representative information in the unsupervised setting. Our experimental results show that LAC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art frameworks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fine-Grained Urban Traffic Forecasting on Metropolis-Scale Road Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02278v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02259v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 20 figures, Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are LLMs Better GNN Helpers? Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01910v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.</p></details> | 14 pages |

These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FraudSquad-5389/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Bundling with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Inference on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17599v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, and an appendix</p></details> |

Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate consistent function representations across architectures, vital for \textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer and algorithmic improvements. We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchy-Aware Neural Subgraph Matching with Enhanced Similarity Measure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00402v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions. Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency, offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.</p></details> |  |

Second, architectural refinements by inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third, rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200 protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper.

We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation (PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while retaining adequate ergodic performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XPgogogo/scCDCG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a long paper for the research track at DASFAA 2024; Error Correction</p></details> |
| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 AI for Science Workshop</p></details> |

However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec, that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Diverse Behavioral Traffic: A Heterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25751v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Graph Coarsening for Efficient GNN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25706v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular, we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoREX: Towards Self-Explainable Social Recommendation with Relevant Ego-Path Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00080v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation has been proven effective in addressing data sparsity in user-item interaction modeling by leveraging social networks. The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/antman9914/SoREX.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |

An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV submission. 13 pages, including the main text (8 pages), references, and supplementary material</p></details> |

| **[Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25486v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</p></details> |  |
| **[GESA: Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation for Generalized, Fair, and Explainable Candidate-Role Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25435v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring, academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems. Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility, persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation), a comprehensive framework that addresses these limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings, heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories, and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and non-profit sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Vulnerabilities in Temporal Graph Neural Networks via Strategic High-Impact Assaults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25418v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks, communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic, easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection (to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT) demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Dynamic Image Graph Construction on FPGA for Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25121v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Graph Neural Networks (Vision GNNs, or ViGs) represent images as unstructured graphs, achieving state of the art performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates. However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC baselines.</p></details> | IEEE HPEC 2025 |

While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.</p></details> |  |

Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks.

Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that admit universal approximation properties. We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.</p></details> |  |

Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35, confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.</p></details> | 8 page,3 figures |
| **[Beyond Softmax: A Natural Parameterization for Categorical Random Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24728v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1) revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the $\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$ is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases. Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community detection robustness of graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24662v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Based Learning of Free Surface Dynamics in Generalized Newtonian Fluids using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24264v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for efficiently predicting the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids with free surface dynamics. The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions. Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult. The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and droplet impact simulations. The results underscore the potential of GNN-based simulation frameworks for efficiently modeling non-Newtonian fluid behavior, paving the way for future advancements in data-driven fluid simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Difference-in-Differences Under Network Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24259v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops doubly robust estimators for direct (DATT) and spillover (SATT) average treatment effects on the treated in network-based difference-in-differences (DiD) designs. Unlike standard DiD methods, the proposed approach explicitly accommodates treatment spillovers and high-dimensional network confounding arising from complex inter-unit dependencies. Identification relies on a conditional parallel-trends assumption that holds after adjusting for high-dimensional network confounders. The estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal as the network size increases, and we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate nuisance functions. Simulation studies and an empirical application to U.S. county-level mask mandates and their impact on COVID-19 transmission demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance, addressing limitations of conventional DiD methods that ignore network interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAPT: Lightweight, Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields Without Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24115v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 to...</summary><p>14 total pages of main content, 4 of references, 3 in Appendix</p></details> |

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00647v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Neural Networks to Logical Theories: The Correspondence between Fibring Modal Logics and Fibring Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23912v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the (pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models \emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders. Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks with the tools of computational logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Universal Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12041v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time GNN Model Evaluation on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23816v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1) They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element, remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Final Layer Holds the Key: A Unified and Efficient GNN Calibration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11335v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated, typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer. Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23671v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pure Node Selection for Imbalanced Graph Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23662v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones.

However, existing heterogeneous graph models often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

This issue is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms various baselines across multiple datasets.

However, their message passing, heavily relying on Clebsch-Gordan tensor product convolutions, suffers from restricted expressiveness due to the limited non-linearity and low degree of group representations. To overcome this, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel plug-and-play framework that applies a Transformer-like architecture to the Fourier spatial domain of group representations. EST achieves higher expressiveness than conventional models while preserving the crucial equivariant inductive bias through a uniform sampling strategy of spherical Fourier transforms. As demonstrated by our experiments on challenging benchmarks like OC20 and QM9, EST-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance. For the complex molecular systems within OC20, small models empowered by EST can outperform some larger models and those using additional data. In addition to demonstrating such strong expressiveness,we provide both theoretical and experimental validation of EST's equivariance as well, paving the way for new research in this area.</p></details> | 26 pages, 3 figures |

Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning.

To address this, we propose flow attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff$\text{'}$s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids) we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR): https://openreview.net/forum?id=tOzg7UxTPD</p></details> |

Detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.</p></details> |  |

These vulnerabilities undermine the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and (ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans. Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\% on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to 74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity, GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, in most real-world settings, such as financial transaction networks and healthcare networks, this data is localized to different data owners and cannot be aggregated due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared model that iteratively aggregates local models trained on decentralized data. This addresses privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. State-of-the-art methods enhance the privacy-respecting convergence accuracy of federated GNN training by sharing remote embeddings of boundary vertices through a server (EmbC). However, they are limited by diminished performance due to large communication costs. In this article, we propose OptimES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that employs remote neighbourhood pruning, overlapping the push of embeddings to the server with local training, and dynamic pulling of embeddings to reduce network costs and training time. We perform a rigorous evaluation of these strategies for four common graph datasets with up to $111M$ vertices and $1.8B$ edges. We see that a modest drop in per-round accuracy due to the preemptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx 3.5\times$ faster than EmbC and giving up to $\approx16\%$ better accuracy than the default federated GNN learning.

| **[Lexicon-Enriched Graph Modeling for Arabic Document Readability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22870v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neighborhood Sampling Does Not Learn the Same Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22868v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the (analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance, which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning with observations that no sampling approach dominates.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning the Neighborhood: Contrast-Free Multimodal Self-Supervised Molecular Graph Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22468v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable 3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich 3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed GNN for medium-high voltage AC power flow with edge-aware attention and line search correction operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22458v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers, especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and 87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$ faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures.

However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels. A temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) model learns to predict relationships between ego-vehicle, agents, and static structures, guided by real-world spatiotemporal interaction patterns and constrained by an ontology that restricts predictions to semantically valid links. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in accurately generating links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We render the predicted scenarios in simulation to further demonstrate their effectiveness as testing environments for AV agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learnable Kernel Density Estimation for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21285v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and generalization. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

Typical efforts enhance MPGNN's expressive power by enriching the adjacency-based aggregation. In contrast, we introduce an efficient aggregation over walk incidence-based matrices that are constructed to deliberately trade off some expressivity for stronger and more structured inductive bias. Our approach allows for seamless scaling between classical message-passing and simpler methods based on walks. We rigorously characterize the expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts over a hierarchy of generalized caterpillar graphs. Based on this foundation, we propose Caterpillar GNNs, whose robust graph-level aggregation successfully tackles a benchmark specifically designed to challenge MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that, on real-world datasets, Caterpillar GNNs achieve comparable predictive performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden layers of the computational graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, preprint in review</p></details> |

However, scaling GNNs to large graphs remains a significant challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN. Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SHAKE-GNN achieves competitive performance while offering improved scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable and Interpretable Jet Physics with IRC-Safe Equivariant Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22059v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in jet classification tasks, yet a key challenge remains: understanding what these models learn and how their features relate to known QCD observables. Improving interpretability is essential for building robust and trustworthy machine learning tools in collider physics. To address this challenge, we investigate graph neural networks for quark-gluon discrimination, systematically incorporating physics-motivated inductive biases. In particular, we design message-passing architectures that enforce infrared and collinear (IRC) safety, as well as E(2) and O(2) equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane. Using simulated jet datasets, we compare these networks against unconstrained baselines in terms of classification performance, robustness to soft emissions, and latent representation structures. Our analysis shows that physics-aware networks are more stable across training instances and distribute their latent variance across multiple interpretable directions. By regressing Energy Flow Polynomials onto the leading principal components, we establish a direct correspondence between learned representations and established IRC-safe jet observables. These results demonstrate that embedding symmetry and safety constraints not only improves robustness but also grounds network representations in known QCD structures, providing a principled approach toward interpretable deep learning in collider physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance; physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead. We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures, MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 27 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22095v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 Figures |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Subgraph Isomorphism Network for Predictive Graph Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21699v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</p></details> |

The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAMR: Efficient and Adaptive Context-Aware Knowledge Graph Question Answering with LLM-Guided MCTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00719v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Existing methods primarily follow either the retrieve-then-reason paradigm, which relies on Graph Neural Networks or heuristic rules to extract static candidate paths, or dynamic path generation strategies that employ LLMs with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former lacks adaptability due to static path extraction and the absence of contextual refinement, while the latter suffers from high computational costs and limited evaluation accuracy because of their dependence on fixed scoring functions and repeated LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with adaptive path evaluation to enable efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR leverages MCTS as a backbone, where an LLM-based planner selects the top-$k$ semantically relevant relations at each expansion step to effectively reduce the search space. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, thereby capturing fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, enabling the scorer to continually adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p></details> |  |

One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 10 pages main text |

In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation. We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.</p></details> |  |

Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 Tables |

To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding the Surgical Scene: A Scoping Review of Scene Graphs in Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20941v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery, charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions. Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide': internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically, the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques. Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis.

Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mesh Interpolation Graph Network for Dynamic and Spatially Irregular Global Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20911v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting, which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |

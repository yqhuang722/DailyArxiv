| **[Overcoming In-Memory Bottlenecks in Graph Foundation Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15124v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Web Conference 2026 (Research Track)</p></details> |
| **[GFM4GA: Graph Foundation Model for Group Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10193v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberGFM: Graph Foundation Models for Lateral Movement Detection in Enterprise Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05988v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing networks as a graph and training a link prediction model using benign connections is an effective method of anomaly-based intrusion detection. Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 11 figures; 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Geometric Structural Knowledge Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22931v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TPAMI, under review</p></details> |
| **[GraphShaper: Geometry-aware Alignment for Improving Transfer Learning in Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12085v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20 percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce \textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and 7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn by the authors due to a fundamental error in the methodology that affects the validity of the main results</p></details> |
| **[SA$^{2}$GFM: Enhancing Robust Graph Foundation Models with Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07857v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) which have made significant progress in various tasks, but their robustness against domain noise, structural perturbations, and adversarial attacks remains underexplored. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of hierarchical structural semantics, which are crucial for generalization. In this paper, we propose SA$^{2}$GFM, a robust GFM framework that improves domain-adaptive representations through Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation. First, we encode hierarchical structural priors by transforming entropy-based encoding trees into structure-aware textual prompts for feature augmentation. The enhanced inputs are processed by a self-supervised Information Bottleneck mechanism that distills robust, transferable representations via structure-guided compression. To address negative transfer in cross-domain adaptation, we introduce an expert adaptive routing mechanism, combining a mixture-of-experts architecture with a null expert design. For efficient downstream adaptation, we propose a fine-tuning module that optimizes hierarchical structures through joint intra- and inter-community structure learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA$^{2}$GFM outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and robustness against random noise and adversarial perturbations for node and graph classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00614v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can TabPFN Compete with GNNs for Node Classification via Graph Tabularization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08798v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large data have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities across domains. Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Rejec...</summary><p>Rejected from LoG 2025 (submitted August 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02216v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoGraph, a scalable autoregressive model for attributed graph generation using decoder-only transformers. By flattening graphs into random sequences of tokens through a reversible process, AutoGraph enables modeling graphs as sequences without relying on additional node features that are expensive to compute, in contrast to diffusion-based approaches. This results in sampling complexity and sequence lengths that scale optimally linearly with the number of edges, making it scalable and efficient for large, sparse graphs. A key success factor of AutoGraph is that its sequence prefixes represent induced subgraphs, creating a direct link to sub-sentences in language modeling. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and molecular benchmarks, with up to 100x faster generation and 3x faster training than leading diffusion models. It also supports substructure-conditioned generation without fine-tuning and shows promising transferability, bridging language modeling and graph generation to lay the groundwork for graph foundation models.

| **[Privacy Auditing of Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained Model under Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17989v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026(Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Effective, Stealthy, and Persistent Backdoor Attacks Targeting Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17982v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Cross-domain Graph Learning: Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11086v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning plays a vital role in mining and analyzing complex relationships within graph data and has been widely applied to real-world scenarios such as social, citation, and e-commerce networks. Foundation models in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain capabilities that are equally significant for graph data. However, existing graph learning approaches often struggle to generalize across domains. Motivated by recent advances in CV and NLP, cross-domain graph learning (CDGL) has gained renewed attention as a promising step toward realizing true graph foundation models. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of existing works on CDGL. We propose a new taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches according to the type of transferable knowledge learned across domains: structure-oriented, feature-oriented, and mixture-oriented. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically summarize representative methods in each category, discuss the key challenges and limitations of current studies, and outline promising directions for future research. A continuously updated collection of related works is available at: https://github.com/cshhzhao/Awesome-Cross-Domain-Graph-Learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Study of Model Extraction Attacks on Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11912v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning has advanced rapidly in tasks such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and node classification. As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Graph Laplacian Eigenvector-based Pre-training Method for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02803v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of self-supervised graph pre-training methods is a crucial ingredient in recent efforts to design robust graph foundation models (GFMs). Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAVER: Generative Graph Vocabularies for Robust Graph Foundation Models Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05592v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the remarkable success of foundation models in language and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) hold significant promise for broad applicability across diverse graph tasks and domains. However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GRAVER over effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency on downstream few-shot node and graph classification tasks compared with 15 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[GMoPE:A Prompt-Expert Mixture Framework for Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03251v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphKeeper: Graph Domain-Incremental Learning via Knowledge Disentanglement and Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00097v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph incremental learning (GIL), which continuously updates graph models by sequential knowledge acquisition, has garnered significant interest recently. However, existing GIL approaches focus on task-incremental and class-incremental scenarios within a single domain. Graph domain-incremental learning (Domain-IL), aiming at updating models across multiple graph domains, has become critical with the development of graph foundation models (GFMs), but remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we propose Graph Domain-Incremental Learning via Knowledge Dientanglement and Preservation (GraphKeeper), to address catastrophic forgetting in Domain-IL scenario from the perspectives of embedding shifts and decision boundary deviations. Specifically, to prevent embedding shifts and confusion across incremental graph domains, we first propose the domain-specific parameter-efficient fine-tuning together with intra- and inter-domain disentanglement objectives. Consequently, to maintain a stable decision boundary, we introduce deviation-free knowledge preservation to continuously fit incremental domains. Additionally, for graphs with unobservable domains, we perform domain-aware distribution discrimination to obtain precise embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed GraphKeeper achieves state-of-the-art results with 6.5%~16.6% improvement over the runner-up with negligible forgetting. Moreover, we show GraphKeeper can be seamlessly integrated with various representative GFMs, highlighting its broad applicative potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Track of NeurIPS-2025</p></details> |
| **[Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing, fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning.

However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together, these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs. To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise. Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in real-world web environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03313v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deeper with Riemannian Geometry: Overcoming Oversmoothing and Oversquashing for Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17457v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing through a global measure -- spectral gap $λ$ -- and prove that the increase of $λ$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this, we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the network depth exceeds $256$ layers.</p></details> | Accept by NeurIPS 25 |

This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stealthy Dual-Trigger Backdoors: Attacking Prompt Tuning in LM-Empowered Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14470v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of graph foundation models (GFMs), particularly those incorporating language models (LMs), has revolutionized graph learning and demonstrated remarkable performance on text-attributed graphs (TAGs). However, compared to traditional GNNs, these LM-empowered GFMs introduce unique security vulnerabilities during the unsecured prompt tuning phase that remain understudied in current research. Through empirical investigation, we reveal a significant performance degradation in traditional graph backdoor attacks when operating in attribute-inaccessible constrained TAG systems without explicit trigger node attribute optimization. To address this, we propose a novel dual-trigger backdoor attack framework that operates at both text-level and struct-level, enabling effective attacks without explicit optimization of trigger node text attributes through the strategic utilization of a pre-established text pool. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our attack maintains superior clean accuracy while achieving outstanding attack success rates, including scenarios with highly concealed single-trigger nodes. Our work highlights critical backdoor risks in web-deployed LM-empowered GFMs and contributes to the development of more robust supervision mechanisms for open-source platforms in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19941v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BooG-EE42/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50736-y}</p></details> |

Existing studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However, the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context, leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically, we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedBook: A Unified Federated Graph Foundation Codebook with Intra-domain and Inter-domain Knowledge Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07755v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models (GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Bringing Graphs to the Table: Zero-shot Node Classification via Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07143v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing GFMs are often trained on datasets that may not fully reflect real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast, tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. In this reformulation, each node is represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns, enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context learning. In this work, we introduce TAG, a tabular approach for graph learning that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders, applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their outputs through ensemble selection. Experiments on 28 real-world datasets demonstrate that TAG consistently improves upon task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of the tabular reformulation for scalable and generalizable graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[GILT: An LLM-Free, Tuning-Free Graph Foundational Model for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04567v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flock: A Knowledge Graph Foundation Model via Learning on Random Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01510v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs), which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations. Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-reasoner: Foundation Models for Unified Reasoning over Graph-structured Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24276v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Foundation Models: Bridging Language Model Paradigms and Graph Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24256v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphPFN: A Prior-Data Fitted Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21489v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However, these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior, allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes, GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their potential in graph machine learning remains largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. While many works on GFMs have focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) like TabPFNv2 or LimiX, we propose G2T-FM, a simple framework for turning tabular foundation models into graph foundation models. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies a TFM to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing competitively with, and often better than, well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines. In particular, when combined with LimiX, G2T-FM often outperforms the best GNN by a significant margin. In summary, our paper reveals the potential of a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54 diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Among the diverse architectures, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erdõs, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erdõs, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphProp: Training the Graph Foundation Models using Graph Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04594v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification. Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However, traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract structural information and provide discriminative graph representations comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in handling graphs without node attributes.</p></details> |  |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed, they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching, recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation, and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our code for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.</p></details> |  |

To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Toward a Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training Transformers With Random Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14098v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A foundation model like GPT elicits many emergent abilities, owing to the pre-training with broad inclusion of data and the use of the powerful Transformer architecture. While foundation models in natural languages are prevalent, can we build similar models for graphs? This paper describes an approach toward a graph foundation model that is pre-trained with diverse graph datasets by adapting the Transformer backbone. A central challenge toward this end is how a sequence model encodes graphs of varying sizes and from different domains. We propose representing a node as multiple random walks, such that the Transformer can extract node representations from sequences, which in turn form edge and graph representations. We develop a novel context prediction loss for these random walks and theoretically analyze their expressive power in distinguishing neighborhoods and graphs. We also demonstrate the pre-training of our model and its adaptation to downstream tasks, showcasing its potential as a foundation for processing and reasoning with graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |

Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[HYPER: A Foundation Model for Inductive Link Prediction with Knowledge Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12362v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result, cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e., relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Expressive are Knowledge Graph Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13339v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) are at the frontier for deep learning on knowledge graphs (KGs), as they can generalize to completely novel knowledge graphs with different relational vocabularies. Despite their empirical success, our theoretical understanding of KGFMs remains very limited. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous study of the expressive power of KGFMs. Specifically, we show that the expressive power of KGFMs directly depends on the motifs that are used to learn the relation representations. We then observe that the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the representations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which limits the model's expressiveness. As part of our study, we design more expressive KGFMs using richer motifs, which necessitate learning relation representations based on, e.g., how triples of relations interact with each other. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings, showing that the use of richer motifs results in better performance on a wide range of datasets drawn from different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGPT: Generative Pre-trained Graph Eulerian Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00529v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduceGraphGPT, a novel self-supervised generative pre-trained model for graph learning based on the Graph Eulerian Transformer (GET). First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD2025 |
| **[Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Models: Robust Knowledge Transfer via Topology Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02017v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[NOCL: Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM for Graph Tasks without Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10014v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1703.00552, arXiv:1403.2844 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441v3)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are pretrained on large-scale corpora to learn generalizable patterns across domains and tasks -- such as contours, textures, and edges in images, or tokens and sentences in text. In contrast, discovering such generalities in graph-structured data, especially across heterogeneous graph tasks, remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach to cross-task generalization in graphs via task-trees, which serve as unified learning instances aligning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks. We theoretically analyze the stability, transferability, and generalization properties of task-trees, showing that pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) on diverse task-trees with a reconstruction objective induces transferable knowledge. This enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To validate our framework, we introduce Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT), a graph foundation model that demonstrates strong performance on over 30 graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot generalization.

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

A Comprehensive Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00829v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with broad applications across various fields. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based approaches for this task. Although many studies demonstrate the impressive performance of LLM-based methods, the lack of clear design guidelines may hinder their practical application. In this work, we aim to establish such guidelines through a fair and systematic comparison of these algorithms. As a first step, we developed LLMNodeBed, a comprehensive codebase and testbed for node classification using LLMs. It includes 10 homophilic datasets, 4 heterophilic datasets, 8 LLM-based algorithms, 8 classic baselines, and 3 learning paradigms. Subsequently, we conducted extensive experiments, training and evaluating over 2,700 models, to determine the key settings (e.g., learning paradigms and homophily) and components (e.g., model size and prompt) that affect performance. Our findings uncover 8 insights, e.g., (1) LLM-based methods can significantly outperform traditional methods in a semi-supervised setting, while the advantage is marginal in a supervised setting; (2) Graph Foundation Models can beat open-source LLMs but still fall short of strong LLMs like GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. We hope that the release of LLMNodeBed, along with our insights, will facilitate reproducible research and inspire future studies in this field.

| **[Relation-Aware Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12027v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising direction in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets through large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on explicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for generalization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training strategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages relation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary in LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store relational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we introduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of aggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens. In addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific projectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node representations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same relation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset pre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments show that REEF significantly outperforms existing methods on both pre-training and transfer learning tasks, underscoring its potential as a powerful foundation model for graph-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLIP-OOD: Zero-Shot Graph OOD Detection with Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21186v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in dynamic and open-world environments. In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has advanced significantly through the use of large-scale pretrained models, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). Our experiments show that, when provided only with class label names for both ID and OOD categories, the GFM can effectively perform OOD detection - often surpassing existing "supervised" OOD detection methods that rely on extensive labeled node data. We further address the practical scenario in which OOD label names are not available in real-world settings by introducing GLIP-OOD, a framework that uses LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These generated OOD labels allow the GFM to better separate ID and OOD classes, facilitating more precise OOD detection - all without any labeled nodes (only ID label names). To our knowledge, this is the first approach to achieve node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and it attains performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: Training on Knowledge Graphs Enables Transferability to General Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12609v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of large language models, there is a trend toward developing graph foundation models to conduct diverse downstream tasks in various domains. However, current models often require extra fine-tuning to apply their learned structural and semantic representations to new graphs, which limits their versatility. Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot inductive reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs), offer us a new perspective on extending KG reasoning to general graph applications. In this paper, we introduce SCR, a unified graph reasoning framework designed to train on knowledge graphs and effectively generalize across a wide range of graph tasks and domains. We begin by designing the task-specific KG structures to establish a unified topology for different task formats. Then we propose semantic-conditioned message passing, a novel mechanism addressing the inherent semantic isolation in traditional KG reasoning, by jointly modeling structural and semantic invariance patterns in graph representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate the inductive reasoning capability of SCR using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our results show substantial performance gains over existing foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p></details> | 25 Pages, 5 figures |
| **[InfoNCE is a Free Lunch for Semantically guided Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06282v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided. Code for IFL-GCL is publicly available at: https://github.com/Camel-Prince/IFL-GCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by SIGIR2025</p></details> |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TKDE; full version (27 pages, 9 figures)</p></details> |

Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often overlook the inherent graph structures in multimodal datasets, where entities and their relationships are crucial. Multimodal graphs (MMGs) represent such graphs where each node is associated with features from different modalities, while the edges capture the relationships between these entities. On the other hand, existing graph foundation models primarily focus on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) and are not designed to handle the complexities of MMGs. To address these limitations, we propose UniGraph2, a novel cross-domain graph foundation model that enables general representation learning on MMGs, providing a unified embedding space. UniGraph2 employs modality-specific encoders alongside a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a unified low-dimensional embedding space that captures both the multimodal information and the underlying graph structure. We propose a new cross-domain multi-graph pre-training algorithm at scale to ensure effective transfer learning across diverse graph domains and modalities. Additionally, we adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) component to align features from different domains and modalities, ensuring coherent and robust embeddings that unify the information across modalities. Extensive experiments on a variety of multimodal graph tasks demonstrate that UniGraph2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in tasks such as representation learning, transfer learning, and multimodal generative tasks, offering a scalable and flexible solution for learning on MMGs.</p></details> | WWW 2025 |
| **[GOFA: A Generative One-For-All Model for Joint Graph Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09709v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/GOFA.</p></details> |  |

These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |

This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2025 Main Track</p></details> |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Transferability Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09363v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to generalize across diverse graph domains and tasks. Some works focus on Domain-Specific GFMs, which are designed to address a variety of tasks within a specific domain, while others aim to create General-Purpose GFMs that extend the capabilities of domain-specific models to multiple domains. Regardless of the type, transferability is crucial for applying GFMs across different domains and tasks. However, achieving strong transferability is a major challenge due to the structural, feature, and distributional variations in graph data. To date, there has been no systematic research examining and analyzing GFMs from the perspective of transferability. To bridge the gap, we present the first comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes and analyzes existing GFMs through the lens of transferability, structuring GFMs around their application scope (domain-specific vs. general-purpose) and their approaches to knowledge acquisition and transfer. We provide a structured perspective on current progress and identify potential pathways for advancing GFM generalization across diverse graph datasets and tasks. We aims to shed light on the current landscape of GFMs and inspire future research directions in GFM development.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the accepted paper (not the IEEE-published version).

| **[Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models as Predictors in Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03258v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing interest in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for graph-based tasks. By leveraging LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across various tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic graph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive tasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the development of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages collaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally, knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge, maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised graph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future design of LLM-based predictors.</p></details> |  |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. IO drivers, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named IOHunter, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in supervised, scarcely-supervised, and cross-IO contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSoDRZXsqj)</p></details> |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

| **[Position: Graph Learning Will Lose Relevance Due To Poor Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14546v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While machine learning on graphs has demonstrated promise in drug design and molecular property prediction, significant benchmarking challenges hinder its further progress and relevance. Current benchmarking practices often lack focus on transformative, real-world applications, favoring narrow domains like two-dimensional molecular graphs over broader, impactful areas such as combinatorial optimization, relational databases, or chip design. Additionally, many benchmark datasets poorly represent the underlying data, leading to inadequate abstractions and misaligned use cases. Fragmented evaluations and an excessive focus on accuracy further exacerbate these issues, incentivizing overfitting rather than fostering generalizable insights. These limitations have prevented the development of truly useful graph foundation models. This position paper calls for a paradigm shift toward more meaningful benchmarks, rigorous evaluation protocols, and stronger collaboration with domain experts to drive impactful and reliable advances in graph learning research, unlocking the potential of graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

While existing research has largely concentrated on learning from individual networks, this study explores the potential of learning from multiple temporal networks and its ability to transfer to unobserved networks. To achieve this, we introduce Temporal Multi-network Training MiNT, a novel pre-training approach that learns from multiple temporal networks. With a novel collection of 84 temporal transaction networks, we pre-train TGL models on up to 64 networks and assess their transferability to 20 unseen networks. Remarkably, MiNT achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot inference, surpassing models individually trained on each network. Our findings further demonstrate that increasing the number of pre-training networks significantly improves transfer performance. This work lays the groundwork for developing Temporal Graph Foundation Models, highlighting the significant potential of multi-network pre-training in TGL.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, preprint version</p></details> |

We evaluate pretrained models on downstream tasks for varying amounts of training samples and choices of pretraining datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that embeddings from pretrained models improve generalization only with enough downstream data points and in a degree which depends on the quantity and properties of pretraining data.

| **[GraphMoRE: Mitigating Topological Heterogeneity via Mixture of Riemannian Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11085v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs have inherently complex and diverse topological patterns, known as topological heterogeneity. Most existing works learn graph representation in a single constant curvature space that is insufficient to match the complex geometric shapes, resulting in low-quality embeddings with high distortion. This also constitutes a critical challenge for graph foundation models, which are expected to uniformly handle a wide variety of diverse graph data. Recent studies have indicated that product manifold gains the possibility to address topological heterogeneity. However, the product manifold is still homogeneous, which is inadequate and inflexible for representing the mixed heterogeneous topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Mixture of Riemannian Experts (GraphMoRE) framework to effectively tackle topological heterogeneity by personalized fine-grained topology geometry pattern preservation. Specifically, to minimize the embedding distortion, we propose a topology-aware gating mechanism to select the optimal embedding space for each node. By fusing the outputs of diverse Riemannian experts with learned gating weights, we construct personalized mixed curvature spaces for nodes, effectively embedding the graph into a heterogeneous manifold with varying curvatures at different points. Furthermore, to fairly measure pairwise distances between different embedding spaces, we present a concise and effective alignment strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with lower distortion, highlighting its potential for modeling complex graphs with topological heterogeneity, and providing a novel architectural perspective for graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Existing approaches for graph representation learning are domain specific, maintaining consistent node and edge features across the pre-training and target datasets. This has precluded transfer to multiple domains. We present Topology Only Pre-Training (ToP), a graph pre-training method based on node and edge feature exclusion. We show positive transfer on evaluation datasets from multiple domains, including domains not present in pre-training data, running directly contrary to assumptions made in contemporary works. On 75% of experiments, ToP models perform significantly $p \leq 0.01$ better than a supervised baseline. Performance is significantly positive on 85.7% of tasks when node and edge features are used in fine-tuning. We further show that out-of-domain topologies can produce more useful pre-training than in-domain. Under ToP we show better transfer from non-molecule pre-training, compared to molecule pre-training, on 79% of molecular benchmarks. Against the limited set of other generalist graph models ToP performs strongly, including against models with many orders of magnitude larger. These findings show that ToP opens broad areas of research in both transfer learning on scarcely populated graph domains and in graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

Despite the significant progress of pre-trained graph neural networks, there haven't been GFMs that can achieve desired performance on various graph-learning-related tasks. Building GFMs may rely on a vocabulary that encodes transferable patterns shared among different tasks and domains. Unlike image and text, defining such transferable patterns for graphs remains an open question. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by rethinking the transferable patterns on graphs as computation trees -- i.e., tree structures derived from the message-passing process. Based on this insight, we propose a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named GFT, short for Graph Foundation model with transferable Tree vocabulary. By treating computation trees as tokens within the transferable vocabulary, GFT improves model generalization and reduces the risk of negative transfer. The theoretical analyses and extensive experimental studies have demonstrated the transferability of computation trees and shown the effectiveness of GFT across diverse tasks and domains in graph learning.

HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as energy and atomic forces. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility.

However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |

However, existing work usually develops separate reasoning models for different KGs, lacking the ability to generalize and transfer knowledge across diverse KGs and reasoning settings. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based KG foundation model via in-context learning, namely KG-ICL, to achieve a universal reasoning ability. Specifically, we introduce a prompt graph centered with a query-related example fact as context to understand the query relation. To encode prompt graphs with the generalization ability to unseen entities and relations in queries, we first propose a unified tokenizer that maps entities and relations in prompt graphs to predefined tokens. Then, we propose two message passing neural networks to perform prompt encoding and KG reasoning, respectively. We conduct evaluation on 43 different KGs in both transductive and inductive settings. Results indicate that the proposed KG-ICL outperforms baselines on most datasets, showcasing its outstanding generalization and universal reasoning capabilities.

| **[Enhance Graph Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11370v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in the real world. Recently, due to the powerful emergent capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in modeling graphs. The key to effectively applying LLMs on graphs is converting graph data into a format LLMs can comprehend. Graph-to-token approaches are popular in enabling LLMs to process graph information. They transform graphs into sequences of tokens and align them with text tokens through instruction tuning, where self-supervised instruction tuning helps LLMs acquire general knowledge about graphs, and supervised fine-tuning specializes LLMs for the downstream tasks on graphs. Despite their initial success, we find that existing methods have a misalignment between self-supervised tasks and supervised downstream tasks, resulting in negative transfer from self-supervised fine-tuning to downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose Graph Alignment Large Language Models (GALLM) to benefit from aligned task templates. In the self-supervised tuning stage, we introduce a novel text matching task using templates aligned with downstream tasks. In the task-specific tuning stage, we propose two category prompt methods that learn supervision information from additional explanation with further aligned templates. Experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in supervised learning, multi-dataset generalizability, and particularly in zero-shot capability, highlighting the model's potential as a graph foundation model.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing approaches pre-train models for specific graph domains, neglecting the inherent connections within networks. This limits their ability to transfer knowledge to various supervised tasks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy on graphs that focuses on modeling their multi-resolution structural information, allowing us to capture global information of the whole graph while preserving local structures around its nodes. We extend the work of Wave}let Positional Encoding (WavePE) from (Ngo et al., 2023) by pretraining a High-Order Permutation-Equivariant Autoencoder (HOPE-WavePE) to reconstruct node connectivities from their multi-resolution wavelet signals. Unlike existing positional encodings, our method is designed to become sensitivity to the input graph size in downstream tasks, which efficiently capture global structure on graphs. Since our approach relies solely on the graph structure, it is also domain-agnostic and adaptable to datasets from various domains, therefore paving the wave for developing general graph structure encoders and graph foundation models. We theoretically demonstrate that there exists a parametrization of such architecture that it can predict the output adjacency up to arbitrarily low error. We also evaluate HOPE-WavePE on graph-level prediction tasks of different areas and show its superiority compared to other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v4)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[On the Scalability of GNNs for Molecular Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11568v4)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning models has been at the heart of recent revolutions in language modelling and image generation. Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Neural Scaling Laws Exist on Graph Self-Supervised Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11243v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning~(SSL) is essential to obtain foundation models in NLP and CV domains via effectively leveraging knowledge in large-scale unlabeled data. The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often struggle to effectively extract generalizable insights, frequently requiring extensive fine-tuning and limiting their versatility. Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphFM: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Graph Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11907v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are typically trained on individual datasets, often requiring highly specialized models and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to build a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored for node classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different domains. Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14899v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A variety of knowledge graph embedding approaches have been developed. Most of them obtain embeddings by learning the structure of the knowledge graph within a link prediction setting. As a result, the embeddings reflect only the structure of a single knowledge graph, and embeddings for different knowledge graphs are not aligned, e.g., they cannot be used to find similar entities across knowledge graphs via nearest neighbor search. However, knowledge graph embedding applications such as entity disambiguation require a more global representation, i.e., a representation that is valid across multiple sources. We propose to learn universal knowledge graph embeddings from large-scale interlinked knowledge sources. To this end, we fuse large knowledge graphs based on the owl:sameAs relation such that every entity is represented by a unique identity. We instantiate our idea by computing universal embeddings based on DBpedia and Wikidata yielding embeddings for about 180 million entities, 15 thousand relations, and 1.2 billion triples. We believe our computed embeddings will support the emerging field of graph foundation models. Moreover, we develop a convenient API to provide embeddings as a service. Experiments on link prediction suggest that universal knowledge graph embeddings encode better semantics compared to embeddings computed on a single knowledge graph. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our source code and datasets open access.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

This is highlighted by the generative capabilities of NLP models like GPT-4, and the retrieval-based approaches of CV models like CLIP, both of which effectively bridge the gap between seen and unseen data. In the realm of graph learning, the continuous emergence of new graphs and the challenges of human labeling also amplify the necessity for zero-shot transfer learning, driving the exploration of approaches that can generalize across diverse graph data without necessitating dataset-specific and label-specific fine-tuning. In this study, we extend such paradigms to zero-shot transferability in graphs by introducing ZeroG, a new framework tailored to enable cross-dataset generalization. Addressing the inherent challenges such as feature misalignment, mismatched label spaces, and negative transfer, we leverage a language model to encode both node attributes and class semantics, ensuring consistent feature dimensions across datasets. We also propose a prompt-based subgraph sampling module that enriches the semantic information and structure information of extracted subgraphs using prompting nodes and neighborhood aggregation, respectively. We further adopt a lightweight fine-tuning strategy that reduces the risk of overfitting and maintains the zero-shot learning efficacy of the language model. The results underscore the effectiveness of our model in achieving significant cross-dataset zero-shot transferability, opening pathways for the development of graph foundation models.

One of the most notable advancements of LLMs is that a single model is trained on vast and diverse datasets spanning multiple domains -- a paradigm we term `All in One'. This methodology empowers LLMs with super generalization capabilities, facilitating an encompassing comprehension of varied data distributions. Leveraging these capabilities, a single LLM demonstrates remarkable versatility across a variety of domains -- a paradigm we term `One for All'. However, applying this idea to the graph field remains a formidable challenge, with cross-domain pretraining often resulting in negative transfer. This issue is particularly important in few-shot learning scenarios, where the paucity of training data necessitates the incorporation of external knowledge sources. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Graph COordinators for PrEtraining (GCOPE), that harnesses the underlying commonalities across diverse graph datasets to enhance few-shot learning. Our novel methodology involves a unification framework that amalgamates disparate graph datasets during the pretraining phase to distill and transfer meaningful knowledge to target tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets demonstrate the superior efficacy of our approach.

A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems.

Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency. The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation. 4) Training Stop Criteria. Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks. To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies. Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research. The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM.</p></details> |  |

| **[Beyond Single-Granularity Prompts: A Multi-Scale Chain-of-Thought Prompt Learning for Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09394v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ``pre-train, prompt" paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method, particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/zhengziyu77/MSGCOT.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW2026 |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphIF: Enhancing Multi-Turn Instruction Following for Large Language Models with Relation Graph Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10051v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Prompting Meets Spiking: Graph Sparse Prompting via Spiking Graph Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02662v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Graph Fine-Tuning with Adversarial Graph Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00229v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method has emerged as a dominant paradigm for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods usually exhibit significant vulnerability to various noise and attacks on graph topology and node attributes/features. To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks validate the robustness and effectiveness of AGP method compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning and Editing Universal Graph Prompt Tuning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08763v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early graph prompt tuning approaches relied on task-specific designs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting their adaptability across diverse pre-training strategies. In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2026 |
| **[Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02937v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Dual Prompting: Hierarchical Debiasing for Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23469v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks, they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer, reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22555v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant malicious triggers to manipulate model predictions. Existing trigger generators are often simplistic in structure and overly reliant on specific features, confining them to a single graph learning paradigm, such as graph supervised learning, graph contrastive learning, or graph prompt learning. This specialized design, which aligns the trigger with one learning objective, results in poor transferability when applied to other learning paradigms. For instance, triggers generated for the graph supervised learning paradigm perform poorly when tested within graph contrastive learning or graph prompt learning environments. Furthermore, these simple generators often fail to utilize complex structural information or node diversity within the graph data. These constraints limit the attack success rates of such methods in general testing scenarios. Therefore, to address these limitations, we propose Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers(CP-GBA), a new transferable graph backdoor attack that employs graph prompt learning(GPL) to train a set of universal subgraph triggers. First, we distill a compact yet expressive trigger set from target graphs, which is structured as a queryable repository, by jointly enforcing class-awareness, feature richness, and structural fidelity. Second, we conduct the first exploration of the theoretical transferability of GPL to train these triggers under prompt-based objectives, enabling effective generalization to diverse and unseen test-time paradigms. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and defense scenarios show that CP-GBA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates.</p></details> |  |

As a common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of *topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph** **T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on multiple node classification datasets.

| **[One Prompt Fits All: Universal Graph Adaptation for Pretrained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22416v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks. Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier should adapt to downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of pretrained models while preserving the input graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Event-Aware Prompt Learning for Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11339v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks. Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Graph Your Own Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23373v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

| **[Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning via Adaptive Weight Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09132v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGMP:Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07405v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25)</p></details> |

Enlightened by prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover, we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries, where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts on average.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.

Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appeared in KDD 2025</p></details> |

A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT).

To efficiently adapt ViG to downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like visual prompting become increasingly essential. However, existing prompting methods are primarily designed for Transformer-based models, neglecting the rich topological relationships among nodes and edges in graph-based representations, limiting their capacity to model complex semantics. In this paper, we propose Vision Graph Prompting (VGP), a novel framework tailored for vision graph structures. Our core insight reveals that semantically connected components in the graph exhibit low-rank properties. Building on this observation, we introduce a semantic low-rank prompting method that decomposes low-rank semantic features and integrates them with prompts on vision graph topologies, capturing both global structural patterns and fine-grained semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly improves ViG's transfer performance on diverse downstream tasks, achieving results comparable to full fine-tuning while maintaining parameter efficiency.

However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods.

Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%.

Most existing studies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational contexts. However, due to the short and sparse nature of conversational contexts, it is difficult to fully capture user preferences by conversational contexts only. We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user preference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a certain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling storyline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt learning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image features of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture higher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities (collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph structures. Finally, we propose an innovative integration of multi-modal semantic graphs with prompt learning, harnessing the power of large language models to comprehensively explore high-dimensional semantic relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves accuracy in item recommendation, as well as generates more natural and contextually relevant content in response generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-Aware Graph Prompt Learning for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17619v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to detect unseen anomaly regions with the guidance of very few normal support images from the same class. Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion.

One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach. We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion. With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peer ...</summary><p>Peer reviewed and published at NLP4KGc @ Semantics 2024, see original publication at https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3874/paper3.pdf .

| **[Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13068v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |

Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

However, inevitable objective gaps often exist between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompt tuning techniques design and learn graph prompts by manipulating input graphs or reframing downstream tasks as pre-training tasks without fine-tuning the pre-trained GNN models. While recent graph prompt tuning methods have proven effective in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks, they overlook the crucial role of edges in graph prompt design, which can significantly affect the quality of graph representations for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose EdgePrompt, a simple yet effective graph prompt tuning method from the perspective of edges. Unlike previous studies that design prompt vectors on node features, EdgePrompt manipulates input graphs by learning additional prompt vectors for edges and incorporates the edge prompts through message passing in the pre-trained GNN models to better embed graph structural information for downstream tasks. Our method is compatible with prevalent GNN architectures pre-trained under various pre-training strategies and is universal for different downstream tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analyses of our method regarding its capability of handling node classification and graph classification as downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on ten graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against six baselines.

These online activities raise significant social concerns that require immediate actions. Existing approaches to combating this challenge are generally impractical, due to the imbalance of classes and scarcity of labeled samples in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a novel Large Language Model-empowered Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning framework for illicit Drug Trafficking detection, called LLM-HetGDT, that leverages LLM to facilitate heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to effectively identify drug trafficking activities in the class-imbalanced scenarios. Specifically, we first pre-train HGNN over a contrastive pretext task to capture the inherent node and structure information over the unlabeled drug trafficking heterogeneous graph (HG). Afterward, we employ LLM to augment the HG by generating high-quality synthetic user nodes in minority classes. Then, we fine-tune the soft prompts on the augmented HG to capture the important information in the minority classes for the downstream drug trafficking detection task. To comprehensively study online illicit drug trafficking activities, we collect a new HG dataset over Twitter, called Twitter-HetDrug. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of LLM-HetGDT.</p></details> |  |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

However, they continue to face challenges such as hallucinations and knowledge cutoffs. These issues can be mitigated through in-context learning by providing LLMs with relevant context before generating answers. Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which integrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially enhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning with large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning mechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate relevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process more efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new Follow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input, with follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions either inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or use special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our experiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial computational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NAACL 2025.

Existing studies on heterogeneous graph prompting typically use feature prompts to modify node features for specific downstream tasks, which do not concern the structure of heterogeneous graphs. Such a design also overlooks information from the meta-paths, which are core to learning the high-order semantics of the heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose CLEAR, a Cluster-based prompt LEARNING model on heterogeneous graphs. We present cluster prompts that reformulate downstream tasks as heterogeneous graph reconstruction. In this way, we align the pretext and downstream tasks to share the same training objective. Additionally, our cluster prompts are also injected into the meta-paths such that the prompt learning process incorporates high-order semantic information entailed by the meta-paths. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks confirm the superiority of CLEAR. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5% improvement on the F1 metric for node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

The prevailing "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the "negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |

However, an objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks limits its effectiveness. Recent graph prompting methods aim to close this gap through task reformulations and learnable prompts. Despite this, they struggle with complex graphs like heterophily graphs. Freezing the GNN encoder can reduce the impact of prompting, while simple prompts fail to handle diverse hop-level distributions. This paper identifies two key challenges in adapting graph prompting methods for complex graphs: (1) adapting the model to new distributions in downstream tasks to mitigate pre-training and fine-tuning discrepancies from heterophily and (2) customizing prompts for hop-specific node requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning (DAGPrompT), which integrates a GLoRA module for optimizing the GNN encoder's projection matrix and message-passing schema through low-rank adaptation. DAGPrompT also incorporates hop-specific prompts accounting for varying graph structures and distributions among hops. Evaluations on 10 datasets and 14 baselines demonstrate that DAGPrompT improves accuracy by up to 4.79 in node and graph classification tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art while preserving efficiency.

Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Nevertheless, GNNs' predictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so it is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the downstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph prompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data leakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can infer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data (publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking the raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference attacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference capabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named ProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the graph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference attack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional disentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant knowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack capabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |

This paper outlines a safety layer that verifies the code generated by ChatGPT before executing it to control a drone in a simulated environment.

Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been proposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the pretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt learning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with minimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the current exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on learning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the diverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming to generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process involves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight architecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and employing the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings showcase the superior performance of IA-GPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Despite its growing prominence, the privacy risks inherent in GPL remain unexplored. In this study, we provide the first evaluation of privacy leakage in GPL across three attacker capabilities: black-box attacks when GPL as a service, and scenarios where node embeddings and prompt representations are accessible to third parties. We assess GPL's privacy vulnerabilities through Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) and Link Inference Attacks (LIAs), finding that under any capability, attackers can effectively infer the properties and relationships of sensitive nodes, and the success rate of inference on some data sets is as high as 98%. Importantly, while targeted inference attacks on specific prompts (e.g., GPF-plus) maintain high success rates, our analysis suggests that the prompt-tuning in GPL does not significantly elevate privacy risks compared to traditional GNNs. To mitigate these risks, we explored defense mechanisms, identifying that Laplacian noise perturbation can substantially reduce inference success, though balancing privacy protection with model performance remains challenging. This work highlights critical privacy risks in GPL, offering new insights and foundational directions for future privacy-preserving strategies in graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods generally focus on a single graph object type (node, edge, graph, etc.) and often overlook the inherent connections among different object types of graph anomalies. For instance, a money laundering transaction might involve an abnormal account and the broader community it interacts with. To address this, we present UniGAD, the first unified framework for detecting anomalies at node, edge, and graph levels jointly. Specifically, we develop the Maximum Rayleigh Quotient Subgraph Sampler (MRQSampler) that unifies multi-level formats by transferring objects at each level into graph-level tasks on subgraphs. We theoretically prove that MRQSampler maximizes the accumulated spectral energy of subgraphs (i.e., the Rayleigh quotient) to preserve the most significant anomaly information. To further unify multi-level training, we introduce a novel GraphStitch Network to integrate information across different levels, adjust the amount of sharing required at each level, and harmonize conflicting training goals. Comprehensive experiments show that UniGAD outperforms both existing GAD methods specialized for a single task and graph prompt-based approaches for multiple tasks, while also providing robust zero-shot task transferability.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge in FGL is to enable effective yet efficient federated optimization against multifaceted graph heterogeneity to enhance mutual performance. However, existing FGL works primarily address graph data heterogeneity and perform incapable of graph task heterogeneity. To address the challenge, we propose a Federated Graph Prompt Learning (FedGPL) framework to efficiently enable prompt-based asymmetric graph knowledge transfer between multifaceted heterogeneous federated participants. Generally, we establish a split federated framework to preserve universal and domain-specific graph knowledge, respectively. Moreover, we develop two algorithms to eliminate task and data heterogeneity for advanced federated knowledge preservation. First, a Hierarchical Directed Transfer Aggregator (HiDTA) delivers cross-task beneficial knowledge that is hierarchically distilled according to the directional transferability. Second, a Virtual Prompt Graph (VPG) adaptively generates graph structures to enhance data utility by distinguishing dominant subgraphs and neutralizing redundant ones. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant accuracy and efficiency effectiveness of FedGPL against multifaceted graph heterogeneity compared to state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale federated graph datasets.</p></details> |  |

Identifying specific effects is crucial for developing safer therapies. Previous works on DDI event prediction have typically been limited to using labels of specific events as supervision, which renders them insufficient to address two significant challenges: (1) the bias caused by \textbf{highly imbalanced event distribution} where certain interaction types are vastly under-represented. (2) the \textbf{scarcity of labeled data for rare events}, a pervasive issue where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-explored due to limited available data. In response, we offer ``DDIPrompt'', an innovative solution inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompt learning. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt features a hierarchical pre-training strategy to foster a generalized and comprehensive understanding of drug properties. It captures intra-molecular structures through augmented links based on structural proximity between drugs, further learns inter-molecular interactions emphasizing edge connections rather than concrete catagories. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate DDIPrompt's SOTA performance, especially for those rare DDI events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable and Compact Graph Fine-tuning via GraphSparse Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21749v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph prompt learning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. However, existing works generally conduct prompting over all graph elements (e.g., nodes, edges, node attributes, etc.), which is suboptimal and obviously redundant. To address this issue, we propose exploiting sparse representation theory for graph prompting and present Graph Sparse Prompting (GSP). GSP aims to adaptively and sparsely select the optimal elements (e.g., certain node attributes) to achieve compact prompting for downstream tasks. Specifically, we propose two kinds of GSP models, termed Graph Sparse Feature Prompting (GSFP) and Graph Sparse multi-Feature Prompting (GSmFP). Both GSFP and GSmFP provide a general scheme for tuning any specific pre-trained GNNs that can achieve attribute selection and compact prompt learning simultaneously. A simple yet effective algorithm has been designed for solving GSFP and GSmFP models. Experiments on 16 widely-used benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSFPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Replay-and-Forget-Free Graph Class-Incremental Learning: A Task Profiling and Prompting Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10341v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continually learn a sequence of tasks, with each task consisting of a set of unique classes. Graph CIL (GCIL) follows the same setting but needs to deal with graph tasks (e.g., node classification in a graph). The key characteristic of CIL lies in the absence of task identifiers (IDs) during inference, which causes a significant challenge in separating classes from different tasks (i.e., inter-task class separation). Being able to accurately predict the task IDs can help address this issue, but it is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show theoretically that accurate task ID prediction on graph data can be achieved by a Laplacian smoothing-based graph task profiling approach, in which each graph task is modeled by a task prototype based on Laplacian smoothing over the graph. It guarantees that the task prototypes of the same graph task are nearly the same with a large smoothing step, while those of different tasks are distinct due to differences in graph structure and node attributes. Further, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge learned in previous graph tasks, we propose a novel graph prompting approach for GCIL which learns a small discriminative graph prompt for each task, essentially resulting in a separate classification model for each task. The prompt learning requires the training of a single graph neural network (GNN) only once on the first task, and no data replay is required thereafter, thereby obtaining a GCIL model being both replay-free and forget-free. Extensive experiments on four GCIL benchmarks show that i) our task prototype-based method can achieve 100% task ID prediction accuracy on all four datasets, ii) our GCIL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 18% in average CIL accuracy, and iii) our model is fully free of forgetting on the four datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.

However, the evolution of historical events are more complicated in real world scenarios and the limited information provided by the event script chain also make it difficult to accurately predict subsequent events. This paper introduces a Causality Graph Event Prediction(CGEP) task that forecasting consequential event based on an Event Causality Graph (ECG). We propose a Semantic Enhanced Distance-sensitive Graph Prompt Learning (SeDGPL) Model for the CGEP task. In SeDGPL, (1) we design a Distance-sensitive Graph Linearization (DsGL) module to reformulate the ECG into a graph prompt template as the input of a PLM; (2) propose an Event-Enriched Causality Encoding (EeCE) module to integrate both event contextual semantic and graph schema information; (3) propose a Semantic Contrast Event Prediction (ScEP) module to enhance the event representation among numerous candidate events and predict consequential event following prompt learning paradigm. %We construct two CGEP datasets based on existing MAVEN-ERE and ESC corpus for experiments. Experiment results validate our argument our proposed SeDGPL model outperforms the advanced competitors for the CGEP task.</p></details> |  |

This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review, we provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to impact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) community.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to temporarily withdraw this draft as I am in the process of making further revisions to improve its content</p></details> |

However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

To reduce labeling requirement, the "pre-train, prompt" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE.

Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose \textbf{One for All (OFA)}, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands. Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution. However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies. To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation. Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views. After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph. Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph. Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views. These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated. Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

While established techniques enable handling multi-modal information, the challenges are posed when extended to various clinical modalities and practical modalitymissing setting due to the inherent modality gaps. To tackle these, we propose an innovative Modality-prompted Heterogeneous Graph for Omnimodal Learning (GTP-4o), which embeds the numerous disparate clinical modalities into a unified representation, completes the deficient embedding of missing modality and reformulates the cross-modal learning with a graph-based aggregation. Specially, we establish a heterogeneous graph embedding to explicitly capture the diverse semantic properties on both the modality-specific features (nodes) and the cross-modal relations (edges). Then, we design a modality-prompted completion that enables completing the inadequate graph representation of missing modality through a graph prompting mechanism, which generates hallucination graphic topologies to steer the missing embedding towards the intact representation. Through the completed graph, we meticulously develop a knowledge-guided hierarchical cross-modal aggregation consisting of a global meta-path neighbouring to uncover the potential heterogeneous neighbors along the pathways driven by domain knowledge, and a local multi-relation aggregation module for the comprehensive cross-modal interaction across various heterogeneous relations. We assess the efficacy of our methodology on rigorous benchmarking experiments against prior state-of-the-arts. In a nutshell, GTP-4o presents an initial foray into the intriguing realm of embedding, relating and perceiving the heterogeneous patterns from various clinical modalities holistically via a graph theory.

| **[MMGPL: Multimodal Medical Data Analysis with Graph Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14574v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has demonstrated impressive efficacy in the fine-tuning of multimodal large models to a wide range of downstream tasks. Nonetheless, applying existing prompt learning methods for the diagnosis of neurological disorder still suffers from two issues: (i) existing methods typically treat all patches equally, despite the fact that only a small number of patches in neuroimaging are relevant to the disease, and (ii) they ignore the structural information inherent in the brain connection network which is crucial for understanding and diagnosing neurological disorders. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel prompt learning model by learning graph prompts during the fine-tuning process of multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Specifically, we first leverage GPT-4 to obtain relevant disease concepts and compute semantic similarity between these concepts and all patches. Secondly, we reduce the weight of irrelevant patches according to the semantic similarity between each patch and disease-related concepts. Moreover, we construct a graph among tokens based on these concepts and employ a graph convolutional network layer to extract the structural information of the graph, which is used to prompt the pre-trained multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance for neurological disorder diagnosis compared with state-of-the-art methods and validated by clinicians.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProG: A Graph Prompt Learning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05346v2)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial general intelligence on graphs has shown significant advancements across various applications, yet the traditional 'Pre-train & Fine-tune' paradigm faces inefficiencies and negative transfer issues, particularly in complex and few-shot settings. Graph prompt learning emerges as a promising alternative, leveraging lightweight prompts to manipulate data and fill the task gap by reformulating downstream tasks to the pretext. However, several critical challenges still remain: how to unify diverse graph prompt models, how to evaluate the quality of graph prompts, and to improve their usability for practical comparisons and selection. In response to these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for graph prompt learning. Our benchmark integrates SIX pre-training methods and FIVE state-of-the-art graph prompt techniques, evaluated across FIFTEEN diverse datasets to assess performance, flexibility, and efficiency. We also present 'ProG', an easy-to-use open-source library that streamlines the execution of various graph prompt models, facilitating objective evaluations. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that categorizes existing graph prompt methods into two main approaches: prompts as graphs and prompts as tokens. This framework enhances the applicability and comparison of graph prompt techniques. The code is available at: https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Graph Selective Prompt Learning for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10498v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompt learning/tuning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained models for graph representation learning. As a kind of universal graph prompt learning method, Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) has achieved remarkable success in adapting pre-trained models for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By fixing the parameters of a pre-trained GNN model, the aim of GPF is to modify the input graph data by adding some (learnable) prompt vectors into graph node features to better align with the downstream tasks on the smaller dataset. However, existing GPFs generally suffer from two main limitations. First, GPFs generally focus on node prompt learning which ignore the prompting for graph edges. Second, existing GPFs generally conduct the prompt learning on all nodes equally which fails to capture the importances of different nodes and may perform sensitively w.r.t noisy nodes in aligning with the downstream tasks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new unified Graph Selective Prompt Feature learning (GSPF) for GNN fine-tuning. The proposed GSPF integrates the prompt learning on both graph node and edge together, which thus provides a unified prompt model for the graph data. Moreover, it conducts prompt learning selectively on nodes and edges by concentrating on the important nodes and edges for prompting which thus make our model be more reliable and compact. Experimental results on many benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSPF method.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of traditional GNNs heavily relies on a large amount of supervision. Recently, ``pre-train, fine-tune'' has become the paradigm to address the issues of label dependency and poor generalization. However, the pre-training strategies vary for graphs with homophily and heterophily, and the objectives for various downstream tasks also differ. This leads to a gap between pretexts and downstream tasks, resulting in ``negative transfer'' and poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), many studies turn to bridge the gap and fully leverage the pre-trained model. However, existing methods for graph prompting are tailored to homophily, neglecting inherent heterophily on graphs. Meanwhile, most of them rely on the randomly initialized prompts, which negatively impact on the stability. Therefore, we propose Self-Prompt, a prompting framework for graphs based on the model and data itself. We first introduce asymmetric graph contrastive learning for pretext to address heterophily and align the objectives of pretext and downstream tasks. Then we reuse the component from pre-training phase as the self adapter and introduce self-prompts based on graph itself for task adaptation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets to demonstrate its superiority.

While GPL offers superior effectiveness in graph knowledge transfer and computational efficiency, the security risks posed by backdoor poisoning effects embedded in pretrained models remain largely unexplored. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of GPL's vulnerability to backdoor attacks. We introduce \textit{CrossBA}, the first cross-context backdoor attack against GPL, which manipulates only the pretraining phase without requiring knowledge of downstream applications. Our investigation reveals both theoretically and empirically that tuning trigger graphs, combined with prompt transformations, can seamlessly transfer the backdoor threat from pretrained encoders to downstream applications. Through extensive experiments involving 3 representative GPL methods across 5 distinct cross-context scenarios and 5 benchmark datasets of node and graph classification tasks, we demonstrate that \textit{CrossBA} consistently achieves high attack success rates while preserving the functionality of downstream applications over clean input. We also explore potential countermeasures against \textit{CrossBA} and conclude that current defenses are insufficient to mitigate \textit{CrossBA}. Our study highlights the persistent backdoor threats to GPL systems, raising trustworthiness concerns in the practices of GPL techniques.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15240v5)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has sparked a research surge in adapting pre-trained models. Unlike the unified pre-training strategy employed in the language field, the graph field exhibits diverse pre-training strategies, posing challenges in designing appropriate prompt-based tuning methods for graph neural networks. While some pioneering work has devised specialized prompting functions for models that employ edge prediction as their pre-training tasks, these methods are limited to specific pre-trained GNN models and lack broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce a universal prompt-based tuning method called Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for pre-trained GNN models under any pre-training strategy. GPF operates on the input graph's feature space and can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect to any form of prompting function. Consequently, we no longer need to illustrate the prompting function corresponding to each pre-training strategy explicitly. Instead, we employ GPF to obtain the prompted graph for the downstream task in an adaptive manner. We provide rigorous derivations to demonstrate the universality of GPF and make guarantee of its effectiveness. The experimental results under various pre-training strategies indicate that our method performs better than fine-tuning, with an average improvement of about 1.4% in full-shot scenarios and about 3.2% in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms existing specialized prompt-based tuning methods when applied to models utilizing the pre-training strategy they specialize in. These numerous advantages position our method as a compelling alternative to fine-tuning for downstream adaptations.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate representation learning on TIGs, researchers have proposed a series of TIG models. However, these models are still facing two tough gaps between the pre-training and downstream predictions in their ``pre-train, predict'' training paradigm. First, the temporal discrepancy between the pre-training and inference data severely undermines the models' applicability in distant future predictions on the dynamically evolving data. Second, the semantic divergence between pretext and downstream tasks hinders their practical applications, as they struggle to align with their learning and prediction capabilities across application scenarios. Recently, the ``pre-train, prompt'' paradigm has emerged as a lightweight mechanism for model generalization. Applying this paradigm is a potential solution to solve the aforementioned challenges. However, the adaptation of this paradigm to TIGs is not straightforward. The application of prompting in static graph contexts falls short in temporal settings due to a lack of consideration for time-sensitive dynamics and a deficiency in expressive power. To address this issue, we introduce Temporal Interaction Graph Prompting (TIGPrompt), a versatile framework that seamlessly integrates with TIG models, bridging both the temporal and semantic gaps. In detail, we propose a temporal prompt generator to offer temporally-aware prompts for different tasks. These prompts stand out for their minimalistic design, relying solely on the tuning of the prompt generator with very little supervision data. To cater to varying computational resource demands, we propose an extended ``pre-train, prompt-based fine-tune'' paradigm, offering greater flexibility. Through extensive experiments, the TIGPrompt demonstrates the SOTA performance and remarkable efficiency advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, due to the immense gap of data and tasks between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, the model performance is still limited. Inspired by prompt fine-tuning in Natural Language Processing(NLP), many endeavors have been made to bridge the gap in graph domain. But existing methods simply reformulate the form of fine-tuning tasks to the pre-training ones. With the premise that the pre-training graphs are compatible with the fine-tuning ones, these methods typically operate in transductive setting. In order to generalize graph pre-training to inductive scenario where the fine-tuning graphs might significantly differ from pre-training ones, we propose a novel graph prompt based method called Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt(IGAP). Firstly, we unify the mainstream graph pre-training frameworks and analyze the essence of graph pre-training from graph spectral theory. Then we identify the two sources of the data gap in inductive setting: (i) graph signal gap and (ii) graph structure gap. Based on the insight of graph pre-training, we propose to bridge the graph signal gap and the graph structure gap with learnable prompts in the spectral space. A theoretical analysis ensures the effectiveness of our method. At last, we conduct extensive experiments among nodes classification and graph classification tasks under the transductive, semi-inductive and inductive settings. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully bridge the data gap under different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Language Models Solve Graph Problems in Natural Language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10037v3)** | 2024-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for a variety of tasks with implicit graphical structures, such as planning in robotics, multi-hop question answering or knowledge probing, structured commonsense reasoning, and more. While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question. The NLGraph benchmark and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/Arthur-Heng/NLGraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graph Prompting for Multi-Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11730v3)** | 2023-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The `pre-train, prompt, predict' paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in open-domain question answering (OD-QA). However, few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LLM-based graph traversal agent that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the graph traversal agent acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[All in One: Multi-task Prompting for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01504v2)** | 2023-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ''pre-training and fine-tuning'' has been adopted as a standard workflow for many graph tasks since it can take general graph knowledge to relieve the lack of graph annotations from each application. However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a ''negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to poor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks. We conduct extensive experiments, results from which demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 23 Best Research Paper Award, which is the first for Hong Kong and Mainland China.

This paper presents a pioneering survey on the emerging domain of graph prompts in AGI, addressing key challenges and opportunities in harnessing graph data for AGI applications. Despite substantial advancements in AGI across natural language processing and computer vision, the application to graph data is relatively underexplored. This survey critically evaluates the current landscape of AGI in handling graph data, highlighting the distinct challenges in cross-modality, cross-domain, and cross-task applications specific to graphs.

| **[Contrastive Graph Prompt-tuning for Cross-domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10685v2)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are frequently challenged by the data sparsity problem. One approach to mitigate this issue is through cross-domain recommendation techniques. In a cross-domain context, sharing knowledge between domains can enhance the effectiveness in the target domain. Recent cross-domain methods have employed a pre-training approach, but we argue that these methods often result in suboptimal fine-tuning, especially with large neural models. Modern language models utilize prompts for efficient model tuning. Such prompts act as a tunable latent vector, allowing for the freezing of the main model parameters. In our research, we introduce the Personalised Graph Prompt-based Recommendation (PGPRec) framework. This leverages the advantages of prompt-tuning. Within this framework, we formulate personalized graph prompts item-wise, rooted in items that a user has previously engaged with. Specifically, we employ Contrastive Learning (CL) to produce pre-trained embeddings that offer greater generalizability in the pre-training phase, ensuring robust training during the tuning phase. Our evaluation of PGPRec in cross-domain scenarios involves comprehensive testing with the top-k recommendation tasks and a cold-start analysis. Our empirical findings, based on four Amazon Review datasets, reveal that the PGPRec framework can decrease the tuned parameters by as much as 74%, maintaining competitive performance. Remarkably, there's an 11.41% enhancement in performance against the leading baseline in cold-start situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Prompt Tuning for Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10131v1)** | 2023-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers have gained popularity in various graph-based tasks by addressing challenges faced by traditional Graph Neural Networks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations and the extensive layering in graph transformer architectures present challenges when applying them to graph based prediction tasks. Fine-tuning, a common approach, is resource-intensive and requires storing multiple copies of large models. We propose a novel approach called deep graph prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging large graph transformer models in downstream graph based prediction tasks. Our method introduces trainable feature nodes to the graph and pre-pends task-specific tokens to the graph transformer, enhancing the model's expressive power. By freezing the pre-trained parameters and only updating the added tokens, our approach reduces the number of free parameters and eliminates the need for multiple model copies, making it suitable for small datasets and scalable to large graphs. Through extensive experiments on various-sized datasets, we demonstrate that deep graph prompt tuning achieves comparable or even superior performance to fine-tuning, despite utilizing significantly fewer task-specific parameters. Our contributions include the introduction of prompt tuning for graph transformers, its application to both graph transformers and message passing graph neural networks, improved efficiency and resource utilization, and compelling experimental results. This work brings attention to a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models in graph based prediction tasks and offers new opportunities for exploring and advancing graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

While many GNN-based solutions have emerged, the supervised paradigm depends on a large quantity of labeled data. A popular alternative is to adopt self-supervised pre-training using label-free data, and further fine-tune on a downstream task with limited labels. Nevertheless, the "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm is often plagued by the objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks. Hence, we propose VPGNN, a prompt-based fine-tuning framework on GNNs for voucher abuse detection. We design a novel graph prompting function to reformulate the downstream task into a similar template as the pretext task in pre-training, thereby narrowing the objective gap. Extensive experiments on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate the strength of VPGNN in both few-shot and semi-supervised scenarios. Moreover, an online deployment of VPGNN in a production environment shows a 23.4% improvement over two existing deployed models.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted by CIKM23 Applied Research Track</p></details> |

Some models also incorporate knowledge bases without the need for pre-training. This is because the base model already contains domain-specific knowledge during the pre-training process. We build a large language model for food testing. Unlike the above approach, a significant amount of data in this domain exists in Scanning format for domain standard documents. In addition, there is a large amount of untrained structured knowledge. Therefore, we introduce an incremental pre-training step to inject this knowledge into a large language model. In this paper, we propose a method for handling structured knowledge and scanned documents in incremental pre-training. To overcome the problem of machine hallucination, we constructe a knowledge graph to serve as an external knowledge base for supporting retrieval in the large language model. It is worth mentioning that this paper is a technical report of our pre-release version, and we will report our specific experimental data in future versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGL-PT: A Strong Graph Learner with Graph Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12449v2)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, much exertion has been paid to design graph self-supervised methods to obtain generalized pre-trained models, and adapt pre-trained models onto downstream tasks through fine-tuning. However, there exists an inherent gap between pretext and downstream graph tasks, which insufficiently exerts the ability of pre-trained models and even leads to negative transfer. Meanwhile, prompt tuning has seen emerging success in natural language processing by aligning pre-training and fine-tuning with consistent training objectives. In this paper, we identify the challenges for graph prompt tuning: The first is the lack of a strong and universal pre-training task across sundry pre-training methods in graph domain. The second challenge lies in the difficulty of designing a consistent training objective for both pre-training and downstream tasks. To overcome above obstacles, we propose a novel framework named SGL-PT which follows the learning strategy ``Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict''. Specifically, we raise a strong and universal pre-training task coined as SGL that acquires the complementary merits of generative and contrastive self-supervised graph learning. And aiming for graph classification task, we unify pre-training and fine-tuning by designing a novel verbalizer-free prompting function, which reformulates the downstream task in a similar format as pretext task. Empirical results show that our method surpasses other baselines under unsupervised setting, and our prompt tuning method can greatly facilitate models on biological datasets over fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |

The approach involves using a pre-trained model and a prompting function that applies a template to input samples, adding indicative context and reformulating target tasks as the pre-training task. However, the design of prompts could be a challenging and time-consuming process in complex tasks. The limitation can be addressed by using graph data, as graphs serve as structured knowledge repositories by explicitly modeling the interaction between entities. In this survey, we review prompting methods from the graph perspective, where prompting functions are augmented with graph knowledge. In particular, we introduce the basic concepts of graph prompt learning, organize the existing work of designing graph prompting functions, and describe their applications and future challenges. This survey will bridge the gap between graphs and prompt design to facilitate future methodology development.</p></details> | 9 pages + 1 figure |

However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-026-50906-6}</p></details> |

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.</p></details> |  |

Theoretically, we show that under certain assumptions, the difference between normalized Laplacians provides an upper bound not only for the difference between the ideal Perfect Alignment contrastive loss and the current loss, but also for the Uniformly loss. Empirically, SpecMatch-CL establishes new state of the art on eight TU benchmarks under unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning at low label rates, and yields consistent gains in transfer learning on PPI-306K and ZINC 2M datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The author thanks Joshua Cape for helpful comments and apologizes for listing him as a coauthor on a previous version of this article without his consent</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning for Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v4)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets. The results show that our proposed model Grad outperforms SOTA methods in both various scenarios, achieving at most 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP, respectively.

| **[CORE: Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13235v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving field of self-supervised learning on graphs, generative and contrastive methodologies have emerged as two dominant approaches. Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, CORE surpasses GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 by up to 2.80% and 3.72% on node classification tasks, and by up to 3.82% and 3.76% on graph classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Rationale-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Jet Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01642v6)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEXA: Legal Case Retrieval via Graph Contrastive Learning with Contextualised LLM Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11791v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a specialised information retrieval task aimed at identifying relevant cases given a query case. LCR holds pivotal significance in facilitating legal practitioners to locate legal precedents. Existing LCR methods predominantly rely on traditional lexical models or language models; however, they typically overlook the domain-specific structural information embedded in legal documents. Our previous work CaseGNN successfully harnesses text-attributed graphs and graph neural networks to incorporate structural legal information. Nonetheless, three key challenges remain in enhancing the representational capacity of CaseGNN: (1) The under-utilisation of rich edge information in text-attributed case graph (TACG). (2) The insufficiency of training signals for graph contrastive learning. (3) The lack of contextualised legal information in node and edge features. In this paper, the LEXA model, an extension of CaseGNN, is proposed to overcome these limitations by jointly leveraging rich edge information, enhanced training signals, and contextualised embeddings derived from large language models (LLMs). Specifically, an edge-updated graph attention layer (EUGAT) is proposed to comprehensively update node and edge features during graph modelling, resulting in a full utilisation of structural information of legal cases. Moreover, LEXA incorporates a novel graph contrastive learning objective with graph augmentation to provide additional training signals, thereby strengthening the model's legal comprehension capabilities. What's more, LLMs are employed to generate node and edge features for TACG. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that LEXA not only significantly improves CaseGNN but also achieves supreme performance compared to state-of-the-art LCR methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2312.11229</p></details> |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels. Then, we jointly train high-pass and low-pass GNNs using both unsupervised contrastive signals and confidence-based supervision to learn robust node representations. Finally, we adopt a stacking framework to fuse predictions from multiple heterogeneous models, further improving generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLoMix outperforms existing methods in mixing address association.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning for Connectome Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05109v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advancements in non-invasive techniques for measuring brain activity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the study of structural and functional brain networks through graph signal processing (GSP) has gained notable prominence. GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |

However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $α\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $α$ yields localized features, while large $α$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $α$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |
| **[Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22555v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant malicious triggers to manipulate model predictions. Existing trigger generators are often simplistic in structure and overly reliant on specific features, confining them to a single graph learning paradigm, such as graph supervised learning, graph contrastive learning, or graph prompt learning. This specialized design, which aligns the trigger with one learning objective, results in poor transferability when applied to other learning paradigms. For instance, triggers generated for the graph supervised learning paradigm perform poorly when tested within graph contrastive learning or graph prompt learning environments. Furthermore, these simple generators often fail to utilize complex structural information or node diversity within the graph data. These constraints limit the attack success rates of such methods in general testing scenarios. Therefore, to address these limitations, we propose Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers(CP-GBA), a new transferable graph backdoor attack that employs graph prompt learning(GPL) to train a set of universal subgraph triggers. First, we distill a compact yet expressive trigger set from target graphs, which is structured as a queryable repository, by jointly enforcing class-awareness, feature richness, and structural fidelity. Second, we conduct the first exploration of the theoretical transferability of GPL to train these triggers under prompt-based objectives, enabling effective generalization to diverse and unseen test-time paradigms. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and defense scenarios show that CP-GBA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General Digraph Contrastive Learning: A Dual Spatial Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16311v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views, S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and 4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

A fundamental challenge in this domain is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the model.

However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01910v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11356v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework introducing two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions, equipping the method with a fallback mechanism guaranteeing a performance lower bound even on non-fractal graphs. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61\%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional and latest baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 4\%. Codes are available at (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FractalGCL-0511/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Gene Regulatory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17786v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and to be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided but a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments and using the latter as explicit supervisory signals. To assess effectiveness, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate their performance on downstream tasks. The evaluation includes both node-level tasks, such as gene function classification, and graph-level tasks on patient-specific GRNs, such as patient survival hazard prediction. Across 13 tasks built from GRN datasets derived from patients with three cancer types, SupGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |

Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.</p></details> | 12page and 8 figures |
| **[CueGCL: Cluster-aware Personalized Self-Training for Unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11073v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as one of the optimal solutions for node-level and supervised tasks. However, for structure-related and unsupervised tasks such as graph clustering, current GCL algorithms face difficulties acquiring the necessary cluster-level information, resulting in poor performance. In addition, general unsupervised GCL improves the performance of downstream tasks by increasing the number of negative samples, which leads to severe class collision and unfairness of graph clustering. To address the above issues, we propose a Cluster-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Framework (CueGCL) to jointly learn clustering results and node representations. Specifically, we design a personalized self-training (PeST) strategy for unsupervised scenarios, which enables our model to capture precise cluster-level personalized information. With the benefit of the PeST, we alleviate class collision and unfairness without sacrificing the overall model performance. Furthermore, aligned graph clustering (AGC) is employed to obtain the cluster partition, where we align the clustering space of our downstream task with that in PeST to achieve more consistent node embeddings. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing it yields an embedding space with a significantly discernible cluster structure. Extensive experimental results also show our CueGCL exhibits state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets with different scales.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Although combining audio and visual signals improves recognition, it is still difficult to align them over time and to reduce the effect of noise across modalities. Existing methods often treat audio and visual streams separately, fusing features later with contrastive or mutual information objectives. Recent advances explore multimodal graph learning, but most fail to distinguish between intra- and inter-modal temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose Temporally Heterogeneous Graph-based Contrastive Learning (THGCL). Our framework constructs a temporal graph for each event, where audio and video segments form nodes and their temporal links form edges. We introduce Gaussian processes for intra-modal smoothness, Hawkes processes for inter-modal decay, and contrastive learning to capture fine-grained relationships. Experiments on AudioSet show that THGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To showcase this, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," as restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL not only effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge but also significantly enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks.

| **[Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05115v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems, demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |

We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Despite notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations. Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,conference</p></details> |
| **[Robust Graph Contrastive Learning with Information Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12555v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework has gained remarkable achievements in graph representation learning. However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world social media data exhibits an imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts. To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by COLING2025</p></details> |

Most existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However, through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2) retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI2024</p></details> |

However, conventional GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety of datasets and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Graph...</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network, Representation Learning</p></details> |

We propose SSEmb, a novel embedding framework capable of capturing both structural and semantic features of mathematical formulas. Structurally, we employ Graph Contrastive Learning to encode formulas represented as Operator Graphs. To enhance structural diversity while preserving mathematical validity of these formula graphs, we introduce a novel graph data augmentation approach through a substitution strategy. Semantically, we utilize Sentence-BERT to encode the surrounding text of formulas. Finally, for each query and its candidates, structural and semantic similarities are calculated separately and then fused through a weighted scheme. In the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval task, SSEmb outperforms existing embedding-based methods by over 5 percentage points on P'@10 and nDCG'@10. Furthermore, SSEmb enhances the performance of all runs of other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results when combined with Approach0.</p></details> |  |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

| **[Revisiting Graph Contrastive Learning on Anomaly Detection: A Structural Imbalance Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14677v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its application to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems. Unfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall detection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance, which can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law degree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail anomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the security and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore hinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly detection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the above issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It devises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and facilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to forged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to enlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor completion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the original and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance evaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates the comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head anomalies and tail anomalies.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Self-supervised graph learning seeks to harness high-order collaborative filtering signals through unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite graph, primarily leveraging a multi-task learning framework that includes both supervised recommendation loss and self-supervised contrastive loss. However, this separate design introduces additional graph convolution processes and creates inconsistencies in gradient directions due to disparate losses, resulting in prolonged training times and sub-optimal performance. In this study, we introduce a unified framework of Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for recommendation (SGCL) to address these issues. SGCL uniquely combines the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses into a cohesive supervised contrastive learning loss, aligning both tasks within a single optimization direction for exceptionally fast training.

To address the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that maximizes mutual information between contrastive views. However, existing GCL methods rely on augmentation techniques that introduce semantically irrelevant noise and incur significant computational and storage costs, limiting effectiveness and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose NLGCL, a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages naturally contrastive views between neighbor layers within GNNs. By treating each node and its neighbors in the next layer as positive pairs, and other nodes as negatives, NLGCL avoids augmentation-based noise while preserving semantic relevance. This paradigm eliminates costly view construction and storage, making it computationally efficient and practical for real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that NLGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys 2025 as Spotlight Oral</p></details> |

However, in this paper, we reveal an unexpected vulnerability: the integration of GCL inadvertently increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. Through both theoretical investigation and empirical validation, we identify the root cause as the spectral smoothing effect induced by contrastive optimization, which disperses item embeddings across the representation space and unintentionally enhances the exposure of target items. Building on this insight, we introduce CLeaR, a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies spectral smoothness, enabling a systematic investigation of the susceptibility of GCL-based recommendation models to targeted promotion attacks. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust countermeasures; in response, we further propose SIM, a spectral irregularity mitigation framework designed to accurately detect and suppress targeted items without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing targeted promotion attacks, GCL-based recommendation models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, current GCL methods primarily focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes, which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL). Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in graph representation learning.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |

Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning, especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes. However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal (negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Effective link prediction on these graphs can uncover valuable connections, such as potential novel drug-disease relations. We introduce a novel multimodal approach that unifies embeddings from specialized Language Models (LMs) with Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) to enhance intra-entity relationships while employing a Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model to capture inter-entity relationships for effective link prediction. To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present PrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including biological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By combining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our approach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link predictions even for unseen nodes.

However, recent findings indicate that the presence of noise in real-world graph data can substantially impair the effectiveness of GNNs. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust and innovative node representation learning method named Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization, or GCL-LRR, which follows a two-stage transductive learning framework for node classification. In the first stage, the GCL-LRR encoder is optimized through prototypical contrastive learning while incorporating a low-rank regularization objective. In the second stage, the representations generated by GCL-LRR are employed by a linear transductive classifier to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes within the graph. Our GCL-LRR is inspired by the Low Frequency Property (LFP) of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank regularization in transductive learning, which is also supported by strong empirical results. To further enhance the performance of GCL-LRR, we present an improved model named GCL-LR-Attention, which incorporates a novel LR-Attention layer into GCL-LRR. GCL-LR-Attention reduces the kernel complexity of GCL-LRR and contributes to a tighter generalization bound, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets evidence the effectiveness and robustness of both GCL-LRR and GCL-LR-Attention in learning meaningful node representations.

| **[Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Degree Bias Adaptively with Hard-to-Learn Nodes in Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05214v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information. This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.</p></details> |  |

WSNET integrates graph structure, node features, and multiple noisy supervision sources through a contrastive objective tailored for weakly labeled data. Across three real world datasets and synthetic benchmarks with controlled noise, WSNET consistently outperforms state of the art contrastive and noisy label learning methods by up to 15% in F1 score.

Existing methods often apply heuristic augmentation like random edge dropping, which may disrupt important graph structures and result in unstable GCL performance. In this paper, we propose Positive-incentive Noise driven Graph Data Augmentation (PiNGDA), where positive-incentive noise (pi-noise) scientifically analyzes the beneficial effect of noise under the information theory. To bridge the standard GCL and pi-noise framework, we design a Gaussian auxiliary variable to convert the loss function to information entropy. We prove that the standard GCL with pre-defined augmentations is equivalent to estimate the beneficial noise via the point estimation. Following our analysis, PiNGDA is derived from learning the beneficial noise on both topology and attributes through a trainable noise generator for graph augmentations, instead of the simple estimation. Since the generator learns how to produce beneficial perturbations on graph topology and node attributes, PiNGDA is more reliable compared with the existing methods. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and stability of PiNGDA.</p></details> |  |

While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph. Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (i.e., ELU-graph), which allows the additional label information to positively influence the predictions of GCN. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13650v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs serve as versatile data structures in numerous real-world domains-including social networks, molecular biology, and knowledge graphs-by capturing intricate relational information among entities. Among graph-based learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs. However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL (Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across various domains.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work in EDA has mainly focused on pretraining models for digital circuits, overlooking analog and mixed-signal circuits. To bridge this gap, we introduce DICE, a Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, which is the first graph neural network (GNN) pretrained via self-supervised learning specifically tailored for graph-level prediction tasks in both analog and digital circuits. DICE adopts a simulation-free pretraining approach based on graph contrastive learning, leveraging two novel graph augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across three downstream tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of DICE for both analog and digital circuits.

| **[Negative Metric Learning for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10307v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) often suffers from false negatives, which degrades the performance on downstream tasks. The existing methods addressing the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric Learning (NML) enhanced GCL (NML-GCL). NML-GCL employs a learnable Negative Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Contrastive Learning through Relative Similarity Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05533v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success by following the computer vision paradigm of preserving absolute similarity between augmented views. However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative similarity over artificial absolute similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025; full version including appendix</p></details> |
| **[InfoNCE is a Free Lunch for Semantically guided Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06282v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided. Code for IFL-GCL is publicly available at: https://github.com/Camel-Prince/IFL-GCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by SIGIR2025</p></details> |
| **[A Generative Graph Contrastive Learning Model with Global Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18148v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has garnered significant attention recently since it learns complex structural information from graphs through self-supervised learning manner. However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from performance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely, they commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which leads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In addition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby ignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building a singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to obtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise perturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL) with an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of hard and easy sample pairs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSG2L outperforms the state-of-art baselines. Moreover, CSG2L is compatible with a variety of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

GCL approaches can be categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that can generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require negative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Submitted to ICML |
| **[Unveiling Contrastive Learning's Capability of Neighborhood Aggregation for Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10113v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized recommendation is widely used in the web applications, and graph contrastive learning (GCL) has gradually become a dominant approach in recommender systems, primarily due to its ability to extract self-supervised signals from raw interaction data, effectively alleviating the problem of data sparsity. A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during graph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on these new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm is effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In this paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient descent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph convolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood aggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability through experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the selection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of CL objective. Based on this discovery, we propose the Light Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (LightCCF) method, which introduces a novel neighborhood aggregation objective to bring users closer to all interacted items while pushing them away from other positive pairs, thus achieving high-quality neighborhood aggregation with very low time complexity. On three highly sparse public datasets, the proposed method effectively aggregate neighborhood information while preventing graph over-smoothing, demonstrating significant improvements over existing GCL-based counterparts in both training efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Our implementations are publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR2025</p></details> |

The process of constructing perturbed views of the user-item bipartite graph and performing contrastive learning between perturbed views in a graph convolutional network (GCN) is called graph contrastive learning (GCL), which aims to enhance the robustness of representation learning. Although existing GCL-based models are effective, the weight assignment method for perturbed views has not been fully explored. A critical problem in existing GCL-based models is the irrational allocation of feature attention. This problem limits the model's ability to effectively leverage crucial features, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning framework (WeightedGCL). Specifically, WeightedGCL applies a robust perturbation strategy, which perturbs only the view of the final GCN layer. In addition, WeightedGCL incorporates a squeeze and excitation network (SENet) to dynamically weight the features of the perturbed views. Our WeightedGCL strengthens the model's focus on crucial features and reduces the impact of less relevant information. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our WeightedGCL achieves significant accuracy improvements compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, including text-to-SQL. While prior works have explored various strategies for prompting LLMs to generate SQL statements, they still fall short of fully harnessing the power of LLM due to the lack of (1) high-quality contextual information when constructing the prompts and (2) robust feedback mechanisms to correct translation errors. To address these challenges, we propose MageSQL, a text-to-SQL approach based on in-context learning over LLMs. MageSQL explores a suite of techniques that leverage the syntax and semantics of SQL queries to identify relevant few-shot demonstrations as context for prompting LLMs. In particular, we introduce a graph-based demonstration selection method -- the first of its kind in the text-to-SQL problem -- that leverages graph contrastive learning adapted with SQL-specific data augmentation strategies. Furthermore, an error correction module is proposed to detect and fix potential inaccuracies in the generated SQL query. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several benchmarking datasets. The results show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by an obvious margin.</p></details> |  |

Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |

In contrast to traditional supervised learning relying on a large number of labels, GCL exploits augmentation strategies to generate multiple views and positive/negative pairs, both of which greatly influence the performance. Unfortunately, commonly used random augmentations may disturb the underlying semantics of graphs. Moreover, traditional GNNs, a type of widely employed encoders in GCL, are inevitably confronted with over-smoothing and over-squashing problems. To address these issues, we propose GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning (GTCA), which inherits the advantages of both GNN and Transformer, incorporating graph topology to obtain comprehensive graph representations. Theoretical analysis verifies the trustworthiness of the proposed method.

Despite significant advancements in this domain, including methods based on RNNs and self-attention, challenges like limited supervised signals and noisy data caused by unintentional clicks persist. To address these challenges, some studies have incorporated unsupervised learning by leveraging local item contexts within individual sequences. However, these methods often overlook the intricate associations between items across multiple sequences and are susceptible to noise in item co-occurrence patterns. In this context, we introduce a novel framework, Global Unsupervised Data-Augmentation (UDA4SR), which adopts a graph contrastive learning perspective to generate more robust item embeddings for sequential recommendation. Our approach begins by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, which serves as the first step to enhance the diversity and richness of the training data. Then, we build a Global Item Relationship Graph (GIG) based on all user interaction sequences. Subsequently, we employ graph contrastive learning on the refined graph to enhance item embeddings by capturing complex global associations. To model users' dynamic and diverse interests more effectively, we enhance the CapsNet module with a novel target-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UDA4SR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does GCL Need a Large Number of Negative Samples? Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Effective and Efficient Negative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17908v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to self-supervised learn low-dimensional graph representations, primarily through instance discrimination, which involves manually mining positive and negative pairs from graphs, increasing the similarity of positive pairs while decreasing negative pairs. Drawing from the success of Contrastive Learning (CL) in other domains, a consensus has been reached that the effectiveness of GCLs depends on a large number of negative pairs. As a result, despite the significant computational overhead, GCLs typically leverage as many negative node pairs as possible to improve model performance. However, given that nodes within a graph are interconnected, we argue that nodes cannot be treated as independent instances. Therefore, we challenge this consensus: Does employing more negative nodes lead to a more effective GCL model? To answer this, we explore the role of negative nodes in the commonly used InfoNCE loss for GCL and observe that: (1) Counterintuitively, a large number of negative nodes can actually hinder the model's ability to distinguish nodes with different semantics. (2) A smaller number of high-quality and non-topologically coupled negative nodes are sufficient to enhance the discriminability of representations. Based on these findings, we propose a new method called GCL with Effective and Efficient Negative samples, E2Neg, which learns discriminative representations using only a very small set of representative negative samples. E2Neg significantly reduces computational overhead and speeds up model training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of E2Neg across multiple datasets compared to other GCL methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate data sparsity issues by improving representation learning through contrastive view generation and mutual information maximization. However, existing approaches lack effective data augmentation strategies. Structural augmentation risks distorting fundamental graph topology, while feature-level perturbation techniques predominantly employ uniform noise scales that fail to account for node-specific characteristics. To solve these challenges, we propose Diffusion-augmented Contrastive Learning (DGCL), an innovative framework that integrates diffusion models with contrastive learning for enhanced collaborative filtering. Our approach employs a diffusion process that learns node-specific Gaussian distributions of representations, thereby generating semantically consistent yet diversified contrastive views through reverse diffusion sampling. DGCL facilitates adaptive data augmentation based on reconstructed representations, considering both semantic coherence and node-specific features. In addition, it explores unrepresented regions of the latent sparse feature space, thereby enriching the diversity of contrastive views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCL on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively.

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization.

However, traditional approaches often neglect the critical role of subgraph structures, particularly the intra-subgraph characteristics and inter-subgraph relationships, which are crucial for generating informative and diverse contrastive pairs. These subgraph features are crucial as they vary significantly across different graph types, such as social networks where they represent communities, and biochemical networks where they symbolize molecular interactions. To address this issue, our work proposes a novel subgraph-oriented learnable augmentation method for graph contrastive learning, termed SOLA-GCL, that centers around subgraphs, taking full advantage of the subgraph information for data augmentation. Specifically, SOLA-GCL initially partitions a graph into multiple densely connected subgraphs based on their intrinsic properties. To preserve and enhance the unique characteristics inherent to subgraphs, a graph view generator optimizes augmentation strategies for each subgraph, thereby generating tailored views for graph contrastive learning. This generator uses a combination of intra-subgraph and inter-subgraph augmentation strategies, including node dropping, feature masking, intra-edge perturbation, inter-edge perturbation, and subgraph swapping. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various graph learning applications, ranging from social networks to molecules, under semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning settings to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art in GCL.</p></details> |  |

However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two.

Presently, the majority of research methods primarily concentrate on the analysis of amino acid sequences, while investigations predicated on protein structures remain in the nascent stages of exploration. Despite the emergence of several structure-based algorithms in recent years, these are still confronted with inherent challenges: (1) the extraction of intrinsic structural information of proteins typically necessitates the expenditure of substantial computational resources; (2) these models are overly reliant on seen protein data, struggling to effectively unearth interaction cues between unknown proteins. To further propel advancements in this domain, this paper introduces a novel PPI prediction method jointing masked reconstruction and contrastive learning, termed JmcPPI. This methodology dissects the PPI prediction task into two distinct phases: during the residue structure encoding phase, JmcPPI devises two feature reconstruction tasks and employs graph attention mechanism to capture structural information between residues; during the protein interaction inference phase, JmcPPI perturbs the original PPI graph and employs a multi-graph contrastive learning strategy to thoroughly mine extrinsic interaction information of novel proteins. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely utilized PPI datasets demonstrate that JmcPPI surpasses existing optimal baseline models across various data partition schemes.

However, the problem of insufficient supervision, together with representation collapse, largely limits the performance of the GNNs in this field. To alleviate the collapse of node representations in semi-supervised scenario, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, termed Mixed Graph Contrastive Network (MGCN). In our method, we improve the discriminative capability of the latent embeddings by an interpolation-based augmentation strategy and a correlation reduction mechanism. Specifically, we first conduct the interpolation-based augmentation in the latent space and then force the prediction model to change linearly between samples. Second, we enable the learned network to tell apart samples across two interpolation-perturbed views through forcing the correlation matrix across views to approximate an identity matrix. By combining the two settings, we extract rich supervision information from both the abundant unlabeled nodes and the rare yet valuable labeled nodes for discriminative representation learning. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the generality of MGCN compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code of MGCN is available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/MGCN on Github.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Approach to Subgraph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20885v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has become a key method for training deep learning models when labeled data is scarce or unavailable. While graph machine learning holds great promise across various domains, the design of effective pretext tasks for self-supervised graph representation learning remains challenging. Contrastive learning, a popular approach in graph self-supervised learning, leverages positive and negative pairs to compute a contrastive loss function. However, current graph contrastive learning methods often struggle to fully use structural patterns and node similarities. To address these issues, we present a new method called Fused Gromov Wasserstein Subgraph Contrastive Learning (FOSSIL). Our model integrates node-level and subgraph-level contrastive learning, seamlessly combining a standard node-level contrastive loss with the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This combination helps our method capture both node features and graph structure together. Importantly, our approach works well with both homophilic and heterophilic graphs and can dynamically create views for generating positive and negative pairs. Through extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets, we show that FOSSIL outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, relying on predefined augmentations (e.g., node dropping, edge perturbation, attribute masking) may result in the loss of task-relevant information and a lack of adaptability to diverse input data. Furthermore, the selection of negative samples remains rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce HyperGCL, a novel multimodal GCL framework from a hypergraph perspective. HyperGCL constructs three distinct hypergraph views by jointly utilizing the input graph's structure and attributes, enabling a comprehensive integration of multiple modalities in contrastive learning. A learnable adaptive topology augmentation technique enhances these views by preserving important relations and filtering out noise. View-specific encoders capture essential characteristics from each view, while a network-aware contrastive loss leverages the underlying topology to define positive and negative samples effectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperGCL achieves state-of-the-art node classification performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

To this end, Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a leading approach. The embeddings of CL are arranged on a hypersphere where similarity is measured by the cosine distance. However, many real-world graphs, especially of hierarchical nature, cannot be embedded well in the Euclidean space. Although the hyperbolic embedding is suitable for hierarchical representation learning, naively applying CL to the hyperbolic space may result in the so-called dimension collapse, i.e., features will concentrate mostly within few density regions, leading to poor utilization of the whole feature space. Thus, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn high-quality graph embeddings in hyperbolic space. Specifically, we design the alignment metric that effectively captures the hierarchical data-invariant information, as well as we propose a substitute of the uniformity metric to prevent the so-called dimensional collapse. We show that in the hyperbolic space one has to address the leaf- and height-level uniformity related to properties of trees. In the ambient space of the hyperbolic manifold these notions translate into imposing an isotropic ring density towards boundaries of Poincaré ball. Our experiments support the efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by The 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[AS-GCL: Asymmetric Spectral Augmentation on Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13525v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as the foremost approach for self-supervised learning on graph-structured data. GCL reduces reliance on labeled data by learning robust representations from various augmented views. However, existing GCL methods typically depend on consistent stochastic augmentations, which overlook their impact on the intrinsic structure of the spectral domain, thereby limiting the model's ability to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm called AS-GCL that incorporates asymmetric spectral augmentation for graph contrastive learning. A typical GCL framework consists of three key components: graph data augmentation, view encoding, and contrastive loss. Our method introduces significant enhancements to each of these components. Specifically, for data augmentation, we apply spectral-based augmentation to minimize spectral variations, strengthen structural invariance, and reduce noise. With respect to encoding, we employ parameter-sharing encoders with distinct diffusion operators to generate diverse, noise-resistant graph views. For contrastive loss, we introduce an upper-bound loss function that promotes generalization by maintaining a balanced distribution of intra- and inter-class distance. To our knowledge, we are the first to encode augmentation views of the spectral domain using asymmetric encoders. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets across various node-level tasks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM |
| **[Contrastive Learning Meets Pseudo-label-assisted Mixup Augmentation: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Framework from Local to Global](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18357v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various graph representation learning tasks. However, most existing GNNs focus primarily on capturing local information through explicit graph convolution, often neglecting global message-passing. This limitation hinders the establishment of a collaborative interaction between global and local information, which is crucial for comprehensively understanding graph data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning (ComGRL). ComGRL integrates local information into global information to derive powerful representations. It achieves this by implicitly smoothing local information through flexible graph contrastive learning, ensuring reliable representations for subsequent global exploration. Then ComGRL transfers the locally derived representations to a multi-head self-attention module, enhancing their discriminative ability by uncovering diverse and rich global correlations. To further optimize local information dynamically under the self-supervision of pseudo-labels, ComGRL employs a triple sampling strategy to construct mixed node pairs and applies reliable Mixup augmentation across attributes and structure for local contrastive learning. This approach broadens the receptive field and facilitates coordination between local and global representation learning, enabling them to reinforce each other. Experimental results across six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that ComGRL achieves excellent performance in node classification tasks. The code could be available at https://github.com/JinluWang1002/ComGRL.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Fusion Self-supervised Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19692v4)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are widely deployed in various web environments, and self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in this field. Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals. Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques. Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges. i) Data augmentation ($e.g.,$ discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality. ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals. However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Fusion Self-supervised Learning framework for recommendation. Specifically, instead of facilitating data augmentations, we use high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views. Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective. By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior recommendation performance and efficiency of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Short Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09219v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short text classification has gained significant attention in the information age due to its prevalence and real-world applications. Recent advancements in graph learning combined with contrastive learning have shown promising results in addressing the challenges of semantic sparsity and limited labeled data in short text classification. However, existing models have certain limitations. They rely on explicit data augmentation techniques to generate contrastive views, resulting in semantic corruption and noise. Additionally, these models only focus on learning the intrinsic consistency between the generated views, neglecting valuable discriminative information from other potential views. To address these issues, we propose a Simple graph contrastive learning framework for Short Text Classification (SimSTC). Our approach involves performing graph learning on multiple text-related component graphs to obtain multi-view text embeddings. Subsequently, we directly apply contrastive learning on these embeddings. Notably, our method eliminates the need for data augmentation operations to generate contrastive views while still leveraging the benefits of multi-view contrastive learning. Despite its simplicity, our model achieves outstanding performance, surpassing large language models on various datasets.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the issue of heterophily in real-world heterogeneous graphs (HGs) has been largely overlooked. To bridge this research gap, we proposed a novel heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework, termed HGMS, which leverages connection strength and multi-view self-expression to learn homophilous node representations. Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy that enhances the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we introduce a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix. The solved self-expressive matrix serves as an additional augmented view to provide homophilous information and is used to identify false negatives in contrastive loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HGMS across different downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of graph-based structures, such as bipartite graphs, has gained popularity for their ability to analyze complex data relationships. Link prediction is crucial for recommending specific items to users. Traditional methods in this area often involve identifying patterns in the graph structure or using representational techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches encounter difficulties as the volume of data increases. To address these challenges, we propose a model called Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-label Classification (MCGCL). MCGCL leverages contrastive learning to enhance recommendation effectiveness. The model incorporates two training stages: a main task and a subtask. The main task is holistic user-item graph learning to capture user-item relationships. The homogeneous user-user (item-item) subgraph is constructed to capture user-user and item-item relationships in the subtask. We assessed the performance using real-world datasets from Amazon Reviews in multi-label classification tasks. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods confirm the effectiveness of MCGCL, highlighting its potential for improving recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions and the idea of positive-incentive noise, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentations. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges based on the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks on Graph-level Tasks: Comprehensive Experiments, Analysis, and Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perfect Alignment May be Poisonous to Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03977v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to learn node representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones. However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

| **[CLDG: Contrastive Learning on Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14451v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph with complex annotations is the most potent data type, whose constantly evolving motivates further exploration of the unsupervised dynamic graph representation. One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods. Compared with the existing dynamic graph method, the number of model parameters and training time is reduced by an average of 2,001.86 times and 130.31 times on seven datasets, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2023 |
| **[SE-GCL: An Event-Based Simple and Effective Graph Contrastive Learning for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11652v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text representation learning is significant as the cornerstone of natural language processing. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and capture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current mainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation of domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation process, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of GCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing word-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic information in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative textual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph contrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract event blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent inter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical semantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised graph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of the event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data capture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core representation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation techniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic efficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to converge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately achieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed SE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to verify its effectiveness in text representation learning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 tables |

However, edgelevel contrasts are not well explored by most existing GCL methods. Most studies in GCL only regard edges as auxiliary information while updating node features. One of the primary obstacles of edge-based GCL is the heavy computation burden. To tackle this issue, we propose a model that can efficiently learn edge features for GCL, namely AugmentationFree Edge Contrastive Learning (AFECL) to achieve edgeedge contrast. AFECL depends on no augmentation consisting of two parts. Firstly, we design a novel edge feature generation method, where edge features are computed by embedding concatenation of their connected nodes. Secondly, an edge contrastive learning scheme is developed, where edges connecting the same nodes are defined as positive pairs, and other edges are defined as negative pairs. Experimental results show that compared with recent state-of-the-art GCL methods or even some supervised GNNs, AFECL achieves SOTA performance on link prediction and semi-supervised node classification of extremely scarce labels.

To mitigate reliance on cross-view contrasts, we propose \ttt{SIGNA}, a novel single-view graph contrastive learning framework. Regarding the inconsistency between structural connection and semantic similarity of neighborhoods, we resort to soft neighborhood awareness for GCL. Specifically, we leverage dropout to obtain structurally-related yet randomly-noised embedding pairs for neighbors, which serve as potential positive samples. At each epoch, the role of partial neighbors is switched from positive to negative, leading to probabilistic neighborhood contrastive learning effect. Furthermore, we propose a normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence estimator for a better effect of contrastive learning. Surprisingly, experiments on diverse node-level tasks demonstrate that our simple single-view GCL framework consistently outperforms existing methods by margins of up to 21.74% (PPI). In particular, with soft neighborhood awareness, SIGNA can adopt MLPs instead of complicated GCNs as the encoder to generate representations in transductive learning tasks, thus speeding up its inference process by 109 times to 331 times.

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Topic Modeling for Strategic Multiagent Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10501v4)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly GNN, DRL, and PTM methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) ML methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of GNN. Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of RL, and in particular that of multiagent deep reinforcement learning. Single-agent deep RL has been widely used for decision making in demanding game settings. Its application in multiagent settings though is hindered due to, e.g., varying relationships between agents, and non-stationarity of the environment. We describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts, and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes probabilistic topic modeling (PTM) in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. Finally, we identify certain open challenges -- specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Code Analysis via Graph-Guided Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12890v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code analysis tasks, yet they struggle to detect malicious behaviors fragmented across files, whose intricate dependencies easily get lost in the vast amount of benign code. We therefore propose a graph-centric attention acquisition pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to localize malicious behavior. The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and by interpreting these predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing approaches on multiple public and custom datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Targeted Graph Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15474v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) have demonstrated exceptional performance in solving critical problems across diverse domains yet remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks. This work highlights the GNN vulnerability against multi-targeted backdoor attack in graph classification task.

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been withdrawn by the authors due to significant revisions in preparation for conference submission.

However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time. The report details this architecture, its evaluation, and outlines its planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

However, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for repeated queries and large-scale 3D scenarios. Recent purely data-driven networks improve efficiency, yet they often bypass this scattering mechanism, which may compromise physical consistency and generalization. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose U-PINet, a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical network for efficient RCS prediction via 3D electromagnetic scattering reconstruction. Once the scattering quantities are reconstructed, scattered fields and RCS can be evaluated for arbitrary observation directions via the radiation integral. U-PINet explicitly learns physics-consistent intermediate scattering representations by modeling local electromagnetic coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design inspired by near-far field decomposition in fast solvers. A physics-guided graph neural network is incorporated to capture self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding governing equations as residual constraints, U-PINet enables accurate object reconstruction of scattering quantities and consequently reliable RCS prediction across observation directions, while significantly reducing runtime. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet achieves EM-solver-level RCS accuracy and 3D object reconstruction with orders-of-magnitude speedups, and generalizes well to unseen geometries under limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to an Elsevier Journal</p></details> |

Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</p></details> | 29p, 22 figures |
| **[FSX: Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14730v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Preprint</p></details> |
| **[PULSE: Socially-Aware User Representation Modeling Toward Parameter-Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14720v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based social recommendation (SocialRec) has emerged as a powerful extension of graph collaborative filtering (GCF), which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture multi-hop collaborative signals from user-item interactions. These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WWW 2026, 12pages</p></details> |

Classical heuristics struggle with workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) risks overheating. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, a graph neural network surrogate achieving deep learning accuracy at heuristic speeds (2-7ms). GraphPerf-RT is, to our knowledge, the first to unify task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Evidential regression with Normal-Inverse-Gamma priors provides calibrated uncertainty; we validate on makespan prediction for risk-aware scheduling. Experiments on three ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Orin NX, RUBIK Pi) achieve R^2 = 0.81 on log-transformed makespan with Spearman rho = 0.95 and conservative uncertainty calibration (PICP = 99.9% at 95% confidence). Integration with four RL methods demonstrates that multi-agent model-based RL with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction and 82% energy reduction versus model-free baselines, with zero thermal violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by WWW-2026</p></details> |

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories. We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), Main Technical Track</p></details> |

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Existing multimodal methods typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations extracted by pretrained models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations extracted by graph neural networks, under the implicit assumption that introducing an additional modality necessarily yields information gain. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the limitations of this assumption: pretrained models already encode substantial structural information implicitly, leading to strong overlap between the two modalities; moreover, graph encoders are generally less effective than pretrained language models in feature extraction. As a result, naive fusion not only struggles to obtain complementary signals but can also dilute effective discriminative cues due to noise propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-conditioned complementary fusion strategy that uses Fisher information to quantify task relevance, transforming cross-modal interaction from full-spectrum matching into selective fusion within a task-sensitive subspace. Our theoretical analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, this strategy significantly tightens the upper bound on the output error. Based on this insight, we design the TaCCS-DFA framework, which combines online low-rank Fisher subspace estimation with an adaptive gating mechanism to enable efficient task-oriented fusion. Experiments on the BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal benchmarks demonstrate that TaCCS-DFA delivers up to a 6.3-point gain in F1 score with only a 3.4% increase in inference latency, while maintaining low calibration error.</p></details> |  |

The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks are Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13465v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that a single training trajectory can transform a graph neural network into an unsupervised heuristic for combinatorial optimization. Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</p></details> |  |

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

In such networks, multiple AI agents optimize the network to achieve distinct and often competing objectives. As such, conflicts become inevitable and have the potential to degrade performance, cause instability, and disrupt service. Current approaches for conflict detection rely on conflict graphs created based on relationships between AI agents, parameters, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Existing works often rely on complex and computationally expensive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and depend on manually chosen thresholds to create conflict graphs. In this work, we present the first systematic framework for conflict detection in AI-native mobile networks, propose a two-tower encoder architecture for learning interactions based on data from the RAN, and introduce a data-driven sparsity-based mechanism for autonomously reconstructing conflict graphs without manual fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Sparse Circuit Extraction from Billion-Parameter Language Models through Scalable Attribution Graph Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12879v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic interpretability seeks to reverse-engineer neural network computations into human-understandable algorithms, yet extracting sparse computational circuits from billion-parameter language models remains challenging due to exponential search complexity and pervasive polysemanticity. The proposed Hierarchical Attribution Graph Decomposition (HAGD) framework reduces circuit discovery complexity from O(2^n) exhaustive enumeration to O(n^2 log n) through multi-resolution abstraction hierarchies and differentiable circuit search. The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks. On modular arithmetic tasks, the framework achieves up to 91% behavioral preservation ($\pm$2.3\% across runs) while maintaining interpretable subgraph sizes. Cross-architecture transfer experiments suggest that discovered circuits exhibit moderate structural similarity (averaging 67%) across model families, indicating potential shared computational patterns. These results provide preliminary foundations for interpretability at larger model scales while identifying significant limitations in current attribution methodologies that require future advances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Integrated Representation Learning for Crypto Anomaly Detection under Extreme Label Scarcity; Relational Domain-Logic Integration with Retrieval-Grounded Context and Path-Level Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12839v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous trajectories in decentralized crypto networks is fundamentally challenged by extreme label scarcity and the adaptive evasion strategies of illicit actors. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gyuye...</summary><p>Gyuyeon Na, Minjung Park, Soyoun Kim contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

The accurate representation of ocean dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales remains a major challenge in such applications. This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions. These results indicate that the proposed model delivers more accurate short-term forecasts and improved representation of multi-scale ocean dynamics, thereby highlighting its potential to advance data-driven, eddy-resolving global ocean forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Boolean Function-Theoretic Framework for Expressivity in GNNs with Applications to Fair Graph Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12751v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel expressivity framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) grounded in Boolean function theory, enabling a fine-grained analysis of their ability to capture complex subpopulation structures. We introduce the notion of \textit{Subpopulation Boolean Isomorphism} (SBI) as an invariant that strictly subsumes existing expressivity measures such as Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL), biconnectivity-based, and homomorphism-based frameworks. Our theoretical results identify Fourier degree, circuit class (AC$^0$, NC$^1$), and influence as key barriers to expressivity in fairness-aware GNNs. We design a circuit-traversal-based fairness algorithm capable of handling subpopulations defined by high-complexity Boolean functions, such as parity, which break existing baselines. Experiments on real-world graphs show that our method achieves low fairness gaps across intersectional groups where state-of-the-art methods fail, providing the first principled treatment of GNN expressivity tailored to fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12662v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Aware Multiscale Mixture of Experts for Efficient Molecular Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12637v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many molecular properties depend on 3D geometry, where non-covalent interactions, stereochemical effects, and medium- to long-range forces are determined by spatial distances and angles that cannot be uniquely captured by a 2D bond graph. Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLMiner: Finding the Most Frequent k-sized Subgraph via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12416v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ in a target graph is a fundamental graph mining problem with direct implications for Web-related data mining and social network analysis. Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RIPPLE++: An Incremental Framework for Efficient GNN Inference on Evolving Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12347v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs are dynamic, with frequent updates to their structure and features due to evolving vertex and edge properties. These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\times$ on throughput. In distributed settings, RIPPLE++ offers up to $\approx25\times$ higher throughput and $20\times$ lower communication costs compared to recomputing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended full-length version of paper that appeared at ICDCS 2025: "RIPPLE: Scalable Incremental GNN Inferencing on Large Streaming Graphs", Pranjal Naman and Yogesh Simmhan, in International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2025.

However, most existing KGQA methods provide only final answers in the form of KG entities. Without explicit explanations -- ideally in the form of intermediate reasoning process over relevant KG triples, the QA results are difficult to inspect and interpret. Moreover, this limitation prevents the rich and verifiable knowledge encoded in KGs, which is a key advantage of KGQA over LLMs, from being fully leveraged. However, addressing this issue remains highly challenging due to the lack of annotated intermediate reasoning process and the requirement of high efficiency in KGQA. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based Two-Step Reasoning method (GNN2R) that can efficiently retrieve both final answers and corresponding reasoning subgraphs as verifiable rationales, using only weak supervision from widely-available final answer annotations. We extensively evaluated GNN2R and demonstrated that GNN2R substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGQA methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated explanations. The complete code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ruijie-wang-uzh/GNN2R.</p></details> |  |

As AD and FTD propagate along white-matter regions in a global, graph-dependent manner, graph-based neural networks are well suited to capture these patterns. Hence, we introduce ARMARecon, a unified graph learning framework that integrates Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filtering with a reconstruction-driven objective to enhance feature representation and improve classification accuracy. ARMARecon effectively models both local and global connectivity by leveraging 20-bin Fractional Anisotropy (FA) histogram features extracted from white-matter regions, while mitigating over-smoothing. Overall, ARMARecon achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the multi-site dMRI datasets ADNI and NIFD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |

Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional feature maps are reinterpreted as patch-level graphs, where nodes encode both appearance and spatial coordinates, and edges reflect local structural adjacency. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on generic message passing, we introduce a custom structural propagation mechanism that explicitly models relative spatial relations as part of the reasoning process. This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability. While evaluated in a medical imaging context, the framework is domain-agnostic and aligns with the broader vision of graph-based reasoning across artificial intelligence systems. This work contributes to the growing body of research exploring graphs as computational substrates for structure-aware and explainable learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. In addition, we propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results with real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. Further, if we jointly finetune the base embedding fed into GRACE as input together with the rest of the GNN component of GRACE, there is a remarkable boost of 15.8% in performance.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factored Value Functions for Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11401v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Networks for model order reduction of parameterized time-dependent PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11259v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

| **[Theoretically and Practically Efficient Resistance Distance Computation on Large Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11159v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Cognitive Neuroscience and Graph Intelligence: Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph Learning for Web Finance Fraud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11073v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.</p></details> |  |

We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of the paper accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2026).

| **[A Low-Complexity Architecture for Multi-access Coded Caching Systems with Arbitrary User-cache Access Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10175v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregating Direct and Indirect Neighbors through Graph Linear Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16871v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) typically rely on localized message passing, requiring increasing depth to capture long range dependencies. In this work, we introduce Graph Linear Transformations, a linear transformation that realizes direct and indirect feature mixing on graphs through a single, well-defined linear operator derived from the graph structure. By interpreting graphs as walk-summable Gaussian graphical models, we compute these transformations via Gaussian Belief Propagation, enabling each node to aggregate information from both direct and indirect neighbors without explicit enumeration of multi-hop paths. We show that different constructions of the underlying precision matrix induce distinct and interpretable propagation biases, ranging from selective edge-level interactions to uniform structural smoothing, and that Graph Linear Transformations can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to both local message-passing GNNs and dynamic neighborhood aggregation models across homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Superposition in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00928v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts. We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLGC: Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10358v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMPG: MoE-based Adaptive Multi-Perspective Graph Fusion for Protein Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10157v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model achieves better results than other neural network methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An intelligent agent-based simulation of human mobility in extreme urban morphologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in extreme urban morphologies, characterized by high-density vertical structures and linear city layouts. To assess whether agents can navigate efficiently within such unprecedented topologies, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), supervised learning, and graph neural networks (GNNs). The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across multiple vertical levels and varying density scenarios, using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Experiments show that the full AI-integrated architecture enables agents to achieve an average commute time of 7.8--8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89\%, and a reachability index over 91\%, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies indicate that removing intelligent modules such as RL or GNN significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85\% and reachability falling below 70\%. Environmental modeling demonstrates low energy consumption and minimal CO$_2$ emissions when electric modes are prioritized. These results suggest that efficient and sustainable mobility in extreme urban forms is achievable, provided adaptive AI systems, intelligent infrastructure, and real-time feedback mechanisms are implemented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of an age-structured and spatially resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulation model. This combined approach complements classical modeling approaches which are mostly mechanistic and purely data-driven machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a spatial graph with 400 nodes representing German counties. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across horizons of 30-90 day simulation and prediction, allowing up to three contact change points, the surrogate model attains 10-27 \% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

However, most existing AMP classification methods rely primarily on sequence-based representations and fail to capture the spatial structural information critical for accurate identification. Although recent graph-based approaches attempt to incorporate structural information, they typically construct residue- or atom-level graphs that introduce redundant atomic details and increase structural complexity. Furthermore, the class imbalance between the small number of known AMPs and the abundant non-AMPs significantly hinders predictive performance. To address these challenges, we employ lightweight OmegaFold to predict the three-dimensional structures of peptides and construct peptide graphs using C α atoms to capture their backbone geometry and spatial topology. Building on this representation, we propose the Spatial GNN-based AMP Classifier (SGAC), a novel framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract structural features and generate discriminative graph representations. To handle class imbalance, SGAC incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning to cluster structurally similar peptides and separate dissimilar ones through adaptive weighting, and applies Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled samples, achieving balanced and consistent representation learning. Experiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that SGAC significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables (ICPR_2026)</p></details> |

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce GPA(graph neural network (GNN)-based Path-Aware multi-view circuit learning), a novel GNN framework that learns precise, data-driven delay predictions by synergistically fusing three complementary views of circuit structure: And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs)-based functional encoding, post-mapping technology emphasizes critical timing paths. Trained exclusively on real cell delays extracted from critical paths of industrial-grade post-mapping netlists, GPA learns to classify cut delays with unprecedented accuracy, directly informing smarter mapping decisions. Evaluated on the 19 EPFL combinational benchmarks, GPA achieves 19.9%, 2.1% and 4.1% average delay reduction over the conventional heuristics methods (techmap, MCH) and the prior state-of-the-art ML-based approach SLAP, respectively-without compromising area efficiency.</p></details> | 7pages, 4figures |

We introduce a unified benchmarking framework that decouples PEs from architectural choices, enabling a fair comparison across 8 GNN and Transformer models, 9 PEs, and 10 synthetic and real-world datasets. Across more than 500 model-PE-dataset configurations, we find that commonly used expressiveness proxies, including Weisfeiler-Lehman distinguishability, do not reliably predict downstream performance. In particular, highly expressive PEs frequently fail to improve, and can even degrade performance on real-world tasks. At the same time, we identify several simple and previously overlooked model-PE combinations that match or outperform recent state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the strong task-dependence of PEs and underscore the need for empirical validation beyond theoretical expressiveness. To support reproducible research, we release an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating PEs for graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026 Datasets & Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate model with part of the mesh/graph co-rotating with the structure and part of the mesh/graph static. A single layer of interface cells are constructed at the interface between the two parts and are allowed to distort and adapt, which helps in circumventing the difficulty of interpolating information encoded by the neural network at every graph neural network layer. Dedicated reconstruction and re-projection schemes are designed to counter the error caused by the distortion and connectivity change of the interface cells. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow around a 2D oscillating airfoil, and (ii) fluid flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable rollout predictions over hundreds or even a thousand time steps. We further demonstrate that one could enforce accurate, error-bounded prediction results by incorporating the measurements from sparse pressure sensors. In addition to the accurate flow field predictions, the lift and drag force predictions closely match with the computational fluid dynamics calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling fluid flow around rotating structures, and paving the path towards a graph neural network-based surrogate model for more complex scenarios like flow around marine propellers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06614v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to 15.07\% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers, providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph structures.</p></details> |  |

Diagnostic complexity arises from visual symptom overlap with conditions like age-related macular degeneration and hypertensive retinopathy, exacerbated by high misdiagnosis rates in underserved regions. This study introduces TIMM-ProRS, a novel deep learning framework integrating Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph Neural Network (GNN) with multi-modal fusion. TIMM-ProRS uniquely leverages both retinal images and temporal biomarkers (HbA1c, retinal thickness) to capture multi-modal and temporal dynamics. Evaluated comprehensively across diverse datasets including APTOS 2019 (trained), Messidor-2, RFMiD, EyePACS, and Messidor-1 (validated), the model achieves 97.8\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing methods like RSG-Net and DeepDR.

| **[GADPN: Graph Adaptive Denoising and Perturbation Networks via Singular Value Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08230v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.</p></details> |  |

However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: "How important is a node to the structure of the graph?" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11700v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve top performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025.

| **[Rep3Net: An Approach Exploiting Multimodal Representation for Molecular Bioactivity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00521v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of compound potency accelerates early-stage drug discovery by prioritizing candidates for experimental testing. However, many Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approaches for this prediction are constrained by their choice of molecular representation: handcrafted descriptors capture global properties but miss local topology, graph neural networks encode structure but often lack broader chemical context, and SMILES-based language models provide contextual patterns learned from large corpora but are seldom combined with structural features. To exploit these complementary signals, we introduce Rep3Net, a unified multimodal architecture that fuses RDKit molecular descriptors, graph-derived features from a residual graph-convolutional backbone, and ChemBERTa SMILES embeddings. We evaluate Rep3Net on a curated ChEMBL subset for Human PARP1 using fivefold cross validation. Rep3Net attains an MSE of $0.83\pm0.06$, RMSE of $0.91\pm0.03$, $R^{2}=0.43\pm0.01$, and yields Pearson and Spearman correlations of $0.66\pm0.01$ and $0.67\pm0.01$, respectively, substantially improving over several strong GNN baselines. In addition, Rep3Net achieves a favorable latency-to-parameter trade-off thanks to a single-layer GCN backbone and parallel frozen encoders. Ablations show that graph topology, ChemBERTa semantics, and handcrafted descriptors each contribute complementary information, with full fusion providing the largest error reduction. These results demonstrate that multimodal representation fusion can improve potency prediction for PARP1 and provide a scalable framework for virtual screening in early-stage drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20785v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Don't be Afraid of Over-Smoothing And Over-Squashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07419v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-smoothing and over-squashing have been extensively studied in the literature on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over the past years. We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[PLANET v2.0: A comprehensive Protein-Ligand Affinity Prediction Model Based on Mixture Density Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07415v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery represents a time-consuming and financially intensive process, and virtual screening can accelerate it. Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

| **[Graph Attention Specialized Expert Fusion Model for Node Classification: Based on Cora and Pubmed Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15784v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks (GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features. Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.</p></details> | <details><summary>It's ...</summary><p>It's written so poorly, my bad</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Trust the Crowd: A Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07245v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong average performance yet remain unreliable at the instance level, with frequent hallucinations, brittle failures, and poorly calibrated confidence. We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource-constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hallucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing complementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief Is All You Need: Modeling Narrative Archetypes in Conspiratorial Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10105v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features. Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGNL: A Label-Efficient Audio Deepfake Detection System via Spectral-Temporal Graph Non-Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04942v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio deepfake detection is increasingly important as synthetic speech becomes more realistic and accessible. Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p></details> |  |
